# Recovering build 893 — a photographic transcription, not a dump

The project owner's SX-KN7000 runs **PROGRAM 893 / TABLE 80**. Every image this
project holds is **PROGRAM 941 / TABLE 84**. Neither of his is preserved
anywhere — see [the SOFT VERSION screen]({{ site.baseurl }}/kn7000-soft-version/)
for how that was discovered and why it matters.

This page is about what has been done since: **9,472 bytes of build 893 read off
the instrument's own screen and typed in by hand**, and what those bytes say
about the relationship between the two builds.

## 1. How the instrument names its own build

Two of the four numbers on the SOFT VERSION screen are checkable against bytes
we hold, and they are what make a stranger's LCD reading actionable:

| Field | Where the number physically is | Value in our images |
|---|---|---|
| `PROGRAM` | a **compiled-in constant**: `u16` little-endian at program-flash file offset `0x33660C` (CPU `0x4873660C`) | `0x03AD` = **941** |
| `TABLE` | an **ASCII decimal string** in the table image: follow the `u32` at table offset `0x1C` (directory segment 7) → `0x139EE8`, and parse the digits there | the four bytes `"84\n\0"` = **84** |

Both were re-read from `kn7000_program.rom` (0x3F6F01 bytes) and
`kn7000_table.rom` (0x3E94D4 bytes) while writing this page, and both are
identical in the byte-interleaved even/odd pairs MAME actually loads.

The consequence is sharp. `PROGRAM` is an immediate value in flash, so a machine
printing `893` is running **different program-flash bytes** — no setting, no
battery-backed cell, no service procedure can make our image print anything else.
`TABLE` is read out of the table image at run time, so a machine printing `80` is
reading **different table-flash bytes**. His instrument differs from our reference
on *both* devices, in the same direction.

## 2. What was transcribed

`kn7000_disassembly/dumps/build893-photo-transcription/` holds
`screens.json` (one record per photograph, with the source filename, the base
address, and per-screen notes about glare and contested cells) and
`screens.hex` (the same content, address-ordered and human-auditable).

| | |
|---|---|
| Photographs taken | **60** |
| Photographs transcribed | **37** |
| Bytes | **9,472** (37 × 256) |
| Cells marked unknown (`??`) | **17** |
| Independent re-readings | **none** |

Two transcription runs were cut short — one by a usage limit, one interrupted
deliberately — and 37 screens are what completed. The remaining 23 photographs
already exist; they have simply not been read yet.

**Coverage.** Ten screens in the table half and twenty-seven in the program half:

| Half | Base addresses |
|---|---|
| Table (`0x48000000`+) | `48000000`, `48009000`, `48019000`, `48029000`, `48039000`, `48049000`, `48059000`, `48159000`, `48259000`, `48359000` |
| Program (`0x48400000`+) | `48400000`–`48400600` (7 consecutive pages), `48400A00`–`48400D00` (4), `48459000`, `48789000`, `487B9000`, `487C9000`, `487DA000`, `487E9000`–`487ED000` (5), `487F4400`–`487F4900` (6) |

That is 0.11 % of the 8 MB the two halves occupy. The point of these particular
screens is not coverage; it is **calibration** — they are placed where they
constrain the relationship between the two builds.

### Method, and the rules the readers worked under

- **Never guess.** Any cell destroyed by glare or blur is `??`. No inference from
  surrounding context, and explicitly no inference from our build-941 image.
- **All 16 hex columns are present** in these photographs; only the ASCII column
  at the right edge is cut off. So ASCII was **not** available as a cross-check —
  the one free redundancy the screen offers was lost to framing.
- **The colour legend was used.** The viewer highlights cells matching four
  legend bytes (Aqua = `F0`, Yellow = `F7`, Lime = `FF`, Fuchsia = `XX`), which
  encodes those values a second time and settled marginal cells.
- The shots are slightly off-axis, so text rows slope — a row sits 15–20 px
  higher at the right edge than at the left. Measured once and reused.

> **The trap that was hit and survived.** At `0x48400DF0` byte 13, the
> surrounding `EC 01 / 02 / 04 / 10 / 20` progression made `40` look obvious. The
> pixels said `80`. The pixels were right. Any rule that lets a reader "fix" a
> byte toward a pattern — or toward our other ROM — manufactures agreement and
> destroys exactly the build differences being preserved.

## 3. The drift profile — four steps, not one block

Each transcribed screen was correlated against the archived build-941 program
image at every byte shift in ±0x8000. Every screen lands on one clear offset, and
the offsets are **not all the same**.

| Covered address | Drift of 941 relative to 893 | Agreement |
|---|---|---|
| `0x48400000` – `0x48400D00` | **0** | 93.0 – 99.2 % |
| `0x48459000` | **+201** (`0x00C9`) | 96.1 % |
| `0x48789000` | **+6428** (`0x191C`) | **100.0 %** |
| `0x487B9000` – `0x487DA000` | **+6453** (`0x1935`) | 94.1 – 97.7 % |
| `0x487E9000` – `0x487F4900` | **+6451** (`0x1933`) | 91.0 – 100.0 % |

So build 941 is build 893 with **several separate insertions totalling 6,451
bytes** — an ordinary recompilation with code added in more than one place, not
a single patch block.

> **This supersedes an earlier reading.** With only the first 12 screens the
> profile looked like one 6,451-byte insertion. Twelve screens simply did not
> sample the middle of the image. The single-shift model is withdrawn; the
> correlation evidence and the verification argument it rested on still hold.

The final step is **−2 bytes**, which is either a genuine small deletion or a
near-tie in the correlation over a data region. It is the least trustworthy row
in the table and is labelled as such.

**A cross-check from the top of the flash.** On the 893 machine the owner read
`0x487F55CF`–`0x487FFFFF` as one unbroken block of `0xFF`; in our 941 image the
last non-`0xFF` byte is at `0x487F6F00` (value `0x4C`). The gap between those two
end-of-code marks is `0x1931` by subtraction, or `0x1932` bytes counted
inclusively — within a byte or two of the `0x1933` the correlation finds
independently in that region. The point is the order of magnitude and the sign,
not the last digit: an entirely independent observation lands on the same ~6.4 KB.

### The table half

Shift 0 and 96.1 – 100 % agreement from `0x48000000` up to `0x48159000`, then
**+3** at both `0x48259000` and `0x48359000`. Table build 84 therefore carries a
**three-byte insertion** somewhere in `0x48159100` – `0x48259000`.

> ⚠ **One anomaly, unresolved.** The screen at `0x48029000` correlates best at
> **−1088** with 100 % agreement. A negative drift there contradicts every
> neighbour. The likeliest explanation is a spurious high-correlation match
> inside a repetitive record table, but it has **not** been re-checked against
> the photograph and should not be trusted until it is.

## 4. Why 91–99 % is evidence *for* the model, not against it

An obvious objection: if the two builds are the same code displaced, why isn't
agreement 100 % everywhere?

Because **absolute pointers must change when code moves.** Any 32-bit constant
above an insertion point has to be rewritten by that region's drift amount, so
those bytes *should* differ between the builds. The residuals track pointer
density exactly:

- the low-address program screens `0x48400000`–`0x48400600` — the vector table
  and early boot, where nearly every word is an address — score **93 – 97 %**;
- a pure-code page like `0x48789000` scores **exactly 100.0 %**.

A transcription error, by contrast, would be scattered uniformly and would not
prefer the pages full of pointers. Six-to-thirty screens agreeing at 91–100 %
under a *single* shift each also cannot arise from chance: the earlier apparent
"2 % agreement" of the program screens was an artefact of comparing at the wrong
offset, not a reading problem. **The readers were accurate.**

That said, this is the *only* verification these screens have received. A planned
independent structural verifier never ran, and no screen has been transcribed
twice by different readers.

## 5. What to photograph next

Each of these bisects a bracket in which an insertion is known to lie. Roughly
**twelve well-placed shots** can pin an insertion point that brute force would
need ~16,000 photographs to find.

| # | Dial this address | Bracket it bisects | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **`485F1000`** | `0x48459100` – `0x48789000`, 3.19 MB | holds **+6,227 of the 6,451** drift bytes — 97 % of the total change |
| 2 | **`4842CF00`** | `0x48400E00` – `0x48459000`, 0.34 MB | the +201 step |
| 3 | **`481D9000`** | `0x48159100` – `0x48259000` (table) | the table half's 3-byte insertion |
| 4 | `487A1000` | `0x48789100` – `0x487B9000`, 0.19 MB | the +25 step |
| 5 | `48029000` | — | **re-check**: correlates at −1088 with 100 %, contradicting every neighbour |

Before requesting new photography, the **23 untranscribed photographs already in
hand** should be read — they may collapse some brackets for free.

## 6. What this does and does not buy

**Does:** it proves build 893 exists in a specific, describable relationship to
build 941; it gives a free cross-version calibration of the work-RAM layout
(the viewer's four default address slots are digit-for-digit identical on his
machine — see
[what real hardware has already confirmed]({{ site.baseurl }}/kn7000-memory-dump-screen/#what-real-hardware-has-already-confirmed));
and it turns "photograph 4 MB" into "photograph a dozen carefully chosen pages".

**Does not:** it does not preserve build 893. Reconstructing 893 from 941 remains
*conceivable* but is much harder than a single shift — every breakpoint must be
located, and each region's absolute pointers relocated by that region's own
drift. Any artifact produced that way would be **derived, not a dump**, and must
carry that label into every file, hash and catalogue entry it ever appears in.

The two routes that would actually preserve it are the
[in-circuit clip read of IC16/IC17]({{ site.baseurl }}/kn7000-program-rom-clip-read/)
and
[reading the ROM back out of the screen with a video grabber]({{ site.baseurl }}/kn7000-rom-from-the-screen/).
The second is why photography was paused: at 256 bytes per screenful a person
cannot photograph 4 MB, but a capture card holding down one button can.

## Provenance of the numbers on this page

| Claim | How it was checked |
|---|---|
| `PROGRAM` = 941 at file `0x33660C` | re-read from `kn7000_program.rom` while writing this page: `u16` LE = `0x03AD` = 941 |
| `TABLE` = 84 via table offset `0x1C` | re-read: `dir[7]` = `0x139EE8`, bytes there are `"84\n\0"` |
| `PROGRAM : 893` / `TABLE : 80` | **owner testimony, 2026-08-08**, read off the LCD of a real SX-KN7000 |
| 37 screens / 9,472 bytes / 17 unknown cells | counted from `screens.json` (37 records × 256 cells; 17 cells equal to `??`) |
| The transcribed address list | the `base_address` field of all 37 records |
| The four-step drift profile | `DRIFT-ANALYSIS.md` in the transcription directory — correlation of each screen against build 941 at every shift in ±0x8000 |
| `0x487F55CF`–`0x487FFFFF` is all `0xFF` on 893 | owner hardware read, 2026-08-09, via the instrument's own MEMORY DUMP screen |
| Our last non-`0xFF` byte is `0x487F6F00` | `kn7000_program.rom` is `0x3F6F01` bytes, so its final byte sits at CPU `0x487F6F00`; scanned the image and confirmed that byte (`0x4C`) is the highest non-`0xFF` one |
| Nothing here is a dump | stated in the transcription directory's own `README.md`; no reconstructed image exists in any repository |
