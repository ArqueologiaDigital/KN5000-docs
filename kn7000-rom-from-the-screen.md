# Reading ROM out of the screen

The KN7000 will not dump itself — no diagnostic emits flash bytes to MIDI, to
disk or to a serial port, and the update path is write-only (see
[Firmware Robustness & ROM Archival]({{ site.baseurl }}/kn7000-firmware-security/)).
But it will *display* any address it can reach, 256 bytes at a time, on the
[hidden MEMORY DUMP screen]({{ site.baseurl }}/kn7000-memory-dump-screen/) — and
it has a composite **VIDEO OUT** jack on the back.

So: point the video output at a capture card, hold down the page button, and the
instrument reads its own flash out loud for about fifty minutes per 4 MB chip.
**`dumpgrab`** is the tool that turns that video back into bytes.

> **Why bother.** The target is
> [PROGRAM 893]({{ site.baseurl }}/kn7000-build-893-recovery/), an unpreserved
> firmware for which **no oracle exists**. Nothing in this pipeline is allowed to

> (the 16-row address ladder, the colour legend), never on a reference ROM.

Where it lives: `kn7000_mame/tools/dumpgrab/` (commits `74a3457`, and `bf5e97f`
for the real-capture work in progress). The side quest that produced it is
deliberately still filed under `pending/`, because nothing in it has met real
hardware yet.

## 1. What the screen gives you for free

Two redundancies, both printed on every page, and both exploited:

- **The address ladder.** Each of the 16 rows prints its own full 32-bit address,
  and they must ascend by exactly `0x10`. That makes the page's base address a
  **16-way vote**, and a disagreeing row localises a failure to that row.
- **The colour legend.** The viewer highlights any cell whose value matches one of
  four legend bytes. The legend is **read off the screen**, not assumed, because
  those four bytes can be stepped from the panel at run time.

There is a third and it is not used yet: the viewer prints every byte a **second
time as ASCII**, to the right of the hex. That is a fully independent encoding of
the same byte at a different screen position, and it is the single most valuable
unimplemented feature in the tool (§5).

## 2. Measured accuracy — on emulator frames

Everything in this section was measured on 2026-08-09 against
`kn7000_program.rom`, byte for byte. **These are emulator numbers.** MAME hands
the extractor a pixel-exact framebuffer, so they measure the extractor and the
voter, *not* an analog capture chain.

| Run | Range | Source | Frames | Pages | Bytes known | Wrong | **Byte accuracy** | Perfect pages |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| capture 3, `video` | `0x48400000` | `movie.avi` | 828 | 41 | 10,496 (100 % of the sweep) | 14 | **99.866616 %** | 40 / 41 |
| capture 1, `video` | `0x48400000` | `movie.avi` | 555 | 41 | 10,495 | 16 | **99.847546 %** | 40 / 41 |
| capture 1, `frames` | `0x48400000` | 1,108 PNGs | 1,108 | 41 | 10,495 | 16 | **99.847546 %** | 40 / 41 |
| capture 2, `video` | `0x48410000` | `movie.avi` | 822 | 41 | 10,491 | 63 | **99.399485 %** | 38 / 41 |
| one still, `image` | `0x48736300` | 1 PNG | 1 | 1 | 256 | 0 | **100.000000 %** | 1 / 1 |

So: **99.87 % end to end over a 40-page sweep, and 100.00 % on a single still.**

The video and frames modes of capture 1 produced **byte-identical** output through
two completely different input paths (an ffmpeg rawvideo pipe versus Pillow),
which is the cross-check that says the two readers agree with each other.

**A hole is never quietly filled.** Every output carries a mask — one byte per
byte, `0` for never recovered, otherwise the number of frame votes — plus a
coverage report listing the exact holes to re-sweep. A gap can be re-swept in
thirty seconds; an invented byte can never be found again.

### The gate that makes those numbers mean anything

A misplaced grid does not produce obvious garbage — it produces **confident
nonsense**. On a badly framed corpus, **26 % of the bytes scoring above
confidence 0.9 were wrong.** The pipeline therefore refuses any frame whose own
printed addresses do not hang together (at least 12 of the 16 rows must agree on
one page base, counting a two-base split exactly one page apart, which is what a
mid-repaint frame looks like), and zeroes its confidences so a caller that ignores
the refusal still cannot be poisoned.

**Gate on the grid, weight by confidence, abstain per cell.** Three calibration
decisions behind that rule are measured rather than guessed, and each cost a full
re-run:

- **Do not gate on "every cell readable."** That test threw away 192 of 555 frames
  and lost one page entirely, where letting the single unreadable cell abstain
  recovers the other 255 bytes.
- **An unsettled frame votes at half weight.** Measured on the 555-frame sweep:
  214 wrong bytes at full weight, 201 at 0.5, 200 at 0.15 — a small effect,
  because those errors live on pages that *only* unsettled frames ever saw.
- **A claimed tear must be exactly one page wide.** Accepting any multiple of
  `0x100` once let misread address digits file **196 fabricated bytes** at
  `0x48402B00`, three pages past where the sweep ever went — 185 of that run's 201
  wrong bytes were that one invented page.

## 3. Record uncompressed

The most actionable operational finding, and the one that costs nothing to act on.

Cross-frame voting removes *independent* errors geometrically. Measured on an
H.264-medium corpus (500 frames, 42 pages), letting K frames vote per page:

| K frames voting | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 8 | all |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| wrong bytes | 1,279 | 697 | 494 | 312 | 261 | **246** |
| accuracy | 88.10 % | 93.52 % | 95.41 % | 97.10 % | 97.57 % | **97.71 %** |

Most of the win arrives by K = 5, and the curve then **flattens onto a systematic
residual that no number of extra frames can remove**. The same pipeline on the
uncompressed corpus runs from 318 wrong bytes at K = 1 down to **22 at K = all —
97.11 % → 99.80 %**.

> **Compression destroys glyph detail in a way voting cannot recover.** Capture
> lossless (FFV1 in Matroska, or whatever raw format the grabber natively emits)
> at least for every calibration clip. For long production sweeps, transcode
> afterwards; budget 1–5 GB per 4 MB chip.

A second geometry-level finding from the same study: a **720×480 grab must be
resized to 640×480 before decoding** — measured **72.45 %** as-is versus
**99.17 %** after the resize. Non-square pixels wreck the character pitch, and a
few percent of pitch error is three characters of drift by the right-hand end of a
75-character row.

## 4. The firmware's repaint is not atomic — and that is not tearing

This is a property of the KN7000, measured on pixel-exact emulator frames, and it
would corrupt a naive one-frame-per-page grab no matter how good the capture chain
is.

**The viewer repaints its 16 rows across several video frames.** A frame grabbed
during a page flip therefore contains rows from two different pages, and the mix
is **interleaved by row**, not a top/bottom split. A real example — the row
addresses of one recorded frame:

```
48400100  48400010  48400120  48400030  48400140  48400050 ...
```

A single-split model cannot even express that, which is why the detector was
rebuilt around per-row page voting instead.

**How often.** Roughly a third of the frames of a held-button sweep are flagged as
damaged, and the exact share depends on the run:

| Run | Frames | Flagged damaged | Breakdown |
|---|---|---|---|
| 555-frame sweep | 555 | **162 (29.2 %)** | 66 genuine two-page mixes, 74 with too many half-drawn glyphs, 20 with no usable address ladder |
| 25-second sweep | 1,501 | **510 (34 %)** | 283 (55 %) salvaged by per-row page assignment |

**It is handled rather than discarded**, because every row states its own address:
each row is simply filed under the page *it* names. Measured salvage: 73,328 cells
filed from torn frames, 72,896 byte-exact = **99.41 %**. The tear detectors
themselves measure **0.00 % false positives** on 271 verified-clean frames and
97.5 – 100 % detection across four synthetic tear types.

> ⚠ **Do not confuse this with analog tearing.** MAME emits pixel-exact frames, so
> nothing in this work has ever seen field interlace, chroma smear, scaler
> ringing, ADC phase jitter or a dropped frame. The firmware's repaint is measured;
> the capture chain's behaviour is **unassessed**.

**Repaint timing**, which the capture harness depends on: the *idle* repaint
period is **~2,952 ms** (~0.34 Hz) with the 16-row repaint itself taking ~112 ms.
A parked address is therefore re-read about three times a minute, not many times a
second — an earlier note saying the viewer "repaints continuously" had the hazard
right and the rate wrong. The practical consequence is that after dialling an
address the panel is still being painted for up to ~3 s, so a recording that starts
immediately can never catch its start page settled.

**Sweep rate**, holding the orange page rocker (`PART MUTE UP 6`): 40 pages in 464
and 461 frames at 60 Hz = **5.17 – 5.21 pages/s** on the integrated harness, and
~5.4 pages/s on a separate 12-second run. A 4 MB chip is 16,384 pages ≈ **50–53
minutes** of continuous holding. Frames per page: minimum 8, median 11.

## 5. The error class that survives everything

40 of 41 pages come out 256/256; the errors are never spread out. Two causes, and
the second is the one that matters:

1. **A page that was never shown settled** — the auto-repeat interval occasionally
   dips below the repaint time. Two independent passes fix this class.
2. ★ **A page the extractor reads wrong the same way every time.** On one page,
   three *pixel-identical*, fully settled frames (16/16 rows on the ladder, zero
   low-confidence cells) each decode **24 bytes wrong**: `0`→`3`, `F`→`A`, `C`→`D`
   in the right-hand columns, `0`→`C`, `8`→`B` in the bottom rows. This is a
   sub-pixel grid residual biting on exactly the glyph pairs that differ by one
   column of pixels.

Class 2 is **deterministic**, so cross-frame voting cannot touch it, posterior
gating cannot touch it, and — measured, not assumed — **two independent sweeps
mostly cannot either**: merging two passes over the same range dropped only 2
conflicting bytes and left 14 of 16 errors in place, because both passes made the
same mistake on the same page.

```
dumpgrab.py agree --dir pass1 --dir pass2 --out merged
-> agreed bytes 10,493   conflicts dropped 2   accuracy 99.8666 %
```

That is why the honest headline is 99.87 % and not 100 %. Two defences remain
untried: **decoding the ASCII column** as an independent channel, and sweeping in
the **opposite direction** (`DOWN 6`), which is the one variant that might
decorrelate a grid-phase error.

There is **no checksum anywhere in this loop** — the service ROM test reports
PASS/FAIL, not a value. With no oracle, verification has to come from agreement
between independent readings.

## 6. On real captures it refuses every frame — so far

This is the current state, and the refusal is the correct behaviour.

The shipped `dumpgrab.py` **declines every real composite frame tried to date**:
on the best of them it recovers only 4 of the 16 address rows and puts 237 of 256
cells below the confidence floor, so it emits **zero bytes** rather than inventing
any. The atlas is trained on 640×240 emulator output; a real capture is a
different sampling of a different signal.

Phone photographs fail the same way and for the same reason — geometry, not OCR.
An experimental global pitch search lifts one photo from mean confidence 0.078 and
zero usable bytes to 0.509 and **130 of 256 bytes correct** at pitch scale 1.04,
and finds nothing at all on another. A hand-held shot of a curved LCD needs a real
four-corner homography, not a better one-dimensional search.

### Where the loss actually happens

Measured on the same screen through three paths, in units of *native LCD pixels*
so that captures at different resolutions compare directly:

| Path | Sampling (px per native px) | MTF at 3 px | MTF at 2 px | Noise floor |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| emulator framebuffer (ceiling) | 0.99 × 1.01 | **3.255** | above Nyquist | 0.000 |
| real composite capture | 1.61 × 2.06 | **0.245** | **0.008** | 0.015 |

The composite path keeps **7.5 %** of the three-native-pixel contrast, and at the
two-native-pixel period it measures 0.008 — *below its own 0.015 noise floor*. The
intra-glyph stroke information is **absent, not merely attenuated**. A 5×7 font
with one-pixel strokes cannot survive that, which is why the capture end now
matters more than the decoder end.

The hardware explains it. Composite leaves IC104 (`C0HBA0000117`, the colour LCD
controller) from the **GREEN** DAC, through an emitter follower, a 150 Ω resistor,
a ferrite and clamp diodes, straight to the jack — **there is no low-pass filter in
the instrument**, so all band-limiting happens inside IC104 and inside the capture
device. The chip's RED, BLUE and separate-sync outputs are **not connected**: there
is no better video connector to find.

### NTSC beats PAL on this instrument — measured

CUSTOMIZE → VIDEO OUT MODE SETTING is one bit in one register (the firmware stores
`value & 1` at `0x500D35B2` and a library routine copies two bytes of it to the LCD
controller; nothing else in the firmware differs between the two modes). The
question was which produces a bigger, crisper picture for the grabber.

**NTSC**, and not marginally: same page, same VLC snapshot path, same 720×576
frame, the **NTSC panel measures 539 px wide against PAL's 433 px**. The KN7000
centres its picture inside PAL's taller raster instead of using the extra lines, so
PAL spends its resolution on borders.

> Two earlier predictions from this project were wrong here, in *opposite*
> directions — first that PAL would win because it has more lines, then that the
> difference was an artefact of grabber resolution (that one was confounded by a
> hand-drawn capture rectangle). This is the measured answer, and it also settled a
> smaller question: **native VLC snapshots beat hand-cropped preview grabs**,
> clearly and by a lot.

### The calibration page

Real-capture work is scored against a page whose contents are already known:
table page **`0x48019000`**, captured in both modes
(`real-NTSC-48019000.png`, `real-PAL-48019000.png` in the tool directory), with
**all 256 bytes verified row-by-row against the archived ROM**.

> ⚠ **That page is 71 % the single byte `0x77`.** A decoder that always guesses
> `77` scores 71 % and is useless. **Always report accuracy twice**: overall, and
> over the 75 non-`0x77` cells. Conveniently, `0x77` is ASCII `'w'`, so the hex and
> ASCII columns are independently checkable there.

## 7. Standing rule for this work

> **No model reads images.** The image-analysis loop was stopped on 2026-08-10
> because it burned tokens far out of proportion to what it produced. All further
> work on this pipeline happens as **code run locally that prints numbers**; images
> are opened by `cv2`/`PIL` inside the scripts. If a decision genuinely needs an
> eye, the script writes a PNG and a human looks at it.

The salvaged real-capture code is under `tools/dumpgrab/wip-real/`, organised as
four lines of attack: sub-pixel geometry and PSF estimation, decoding in the
*blurred* domain (templates convolved with the measured PSF, whole rows fitted
jointly), the ASCII column as a second channel, and the capture side itself. Only
the last of the four reported before the stop; the rest is unreviewed code of
unknown quality and should be treated as raw material, not as a result.

## 8. What is still unknown

- **The analog chain is unassessed.** The only prediction available is a
  degradation *simulation* whose fidelity is unverified, and two of whose axes are
  documented as misbehaving. Its one honest use is *after* the first real capture:
  decode a page the ROM covers, score it, and see where it lands.
- **The ASCII column is not read.** The one defence against the deterministic error
  class of §5.
- **Photo mode needs a homography**, not a pitch search.
- **Throughput is about 1.4 kB/s** of ROM, and extraction runs at roughly 0.5–2 s
  per frame single-threaded, so an hour-long sweep costs several hours of
  processing. This is an archival method for a handful of chips, not a bulk one.
- **The wave ROMs are out of reach this way.** They are only readable through the
  tone generator's page/offset/data window, not by a plain load, so the viewer
  cannot see them — likewise the sub-CPU, the panel MCU and the USB co-processor.
