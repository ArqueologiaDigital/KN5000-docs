# HD-AE5000 Hard Disk Interface

This page documents the low-level hard disk interface used by the HD-AE5000 expansion for the Technics KN5000 keyboard. Understanding this interface is essential for MAME emulation and homebrew development.

## Overview

The HD-AE5000 uses an **IDE/ATA compatible hard disk drive** with **direct memory-mapped registers**. The ATA registers are accessible at addresses 0x130010-0x130020 from the main CPU.

A separate **Intel 8255 PPI** at 0x160000 provides a parallel port interface for communication with a PC running the HD-TechManager5000 software.

## IDE/ATA Background

### What is IDE/ATA?

**IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics)** and **ATA (AT Attachment)** are standards for connecting hard disk drives to computers. The HD-AE5000 uses a 2.5" laptop-style IDE drive with 1.08GB capacity, which was a substantial amount for 1996-era consumer electronics.

### ATA Register Set (Firmware-Verified)

The HD-AE5000 maps ATA registers directly to memory addresses. The register layout was verified by analyzing firmware code at 0x2974DD-0x297501 and 0x2976AB-0x297883:

| Address | Register | Read | Write |
|---------|----------|------|-------|
| 0x130010 | Data (16-bit) | Sector data | Sector data |
| 0x130012 | Error/Features | Error code | Features |
| 0x130014 | Sector Count | Sector count | Sector count |
| 0x130016 | Sector Number | Sector/LBA Low | Sector/LBA Low |
| 0x130018 | Cylinder Low | Cylinder Low/LBA Mid | Cylinder Low/LBA Mid |
| 0x13001A | Cylinder High | Cylinder High/LBA High | Cylinder High/LBA High |
| 0x13001C | Device/Head | Device/Head | Device/Head (0xA0 \| head) |
| 0x13001E | Status/Command | Status | Command |
| 0x130020 | Device Control | - | Device Control |

The HD-AE5000 firmware uses **CHS (Cylinder/Head/Sector)** addressing, as evidenced by debug strings in the ROM:
- `hddtrck` - Track (cylinder) count
- `hddhead` - Head count
- `hddsctr` - Sectors per track
- `hddscby` - Bytes per sector (typically 512)

### ATA Commands Used by Firmware

The following commands were identified by analyzing firmware writes to the Command Register (0x13001E):

| Command | Hex | Address | Description |
|---------|-----|---------|-------------|
| Read Sectors | 0x20 | 0x29781D | Read one or more sectors (PIO mode) |
| Write Sectors | 0x30 | 0x29772B | Write one or more sectors (PIO mode) |
| Standby | 0x94 | 0x297501 | Spin down drive with timeout parameter |
| Identify Device | 0xEC | 0x2978C3 | Return 512-byte device identification block |

## PPI Parallel Port Interface

### Purpose

The Intel 8255 PPI at 0x160000 is **NOT** used for IDE communication - the IDE registers are directly memory-mapped. Instead, the PPI provides a **parallel port interface for PC communication** with the HD-TechManager5000 Windows software.

This allows file transfer between a PC and the HDAE5000's hard disk via the PC's parallel port.

### PPI Port Assignments

| Address | Port | Direction | Function |
|---------|------|-----------|----------|
| 0x160000 | Port A | Bidirectional | Data byte to/from PC |
| 0x160002 | Port B | Input | Status byte from PC |
| 0x160004 | Port C | Output | Control signals to PC |
| 0x160006 | Control | Write | PPI mode configuration |

    3. Wait for drive ready
```

## Error Handling

The firmware includes multilingual error messages for various disk failures:

| Error | English Message | Likely Cause |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| SRAM Error | "Hard disk SRAM error" | Cache RAM failure on HDAE5000 |
| Reset Error | "Hard disk reset error" | Controller not responding |
| Read Error | "Hard disk read error" | Bad sector or media failure |
| ID Read Error | "Hard disk ID read error" | Identify Device command failed |
| Track 0 Error | "Hard disk track 0 error" | Cannot seek to track 0 |
| FSB Error | "Hard disk FSB read error" | Filesystem block corrupted |
| FAT Error | "Hard disk FAT read error" | File allocation table corrupted |

These errors are also available in German and French translations.

## Filesystem Structure

The HDAE5000 uses a **custom filesystem**, not FAT16 or FAT32. Key structures include:

### FSB (File System Block)

The master filesystem metadata block containing:
- Volume information
- Free space tracking
- Directory pointers

### FGB (File Group Block)

Groups related files together:
- File group pointer (`FGB ptr`)
- Group width (`FGB wid`)
- Number of entries (`FGB num`)

### FEB (File Entry Block)

Individual file metadata:
- File entry pointer (`FEB ptr`)
- Entry width (`FEB wid`)
- Number of entries (`FEB num`)

## PPORT Commands for Disk Operations

The PC parallel port (PPORT) protocol includes these disk-related commands:

| Code | Command | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 01 | Send Infos About HD | Report CHS parameters and model |
| 03 | Read FSB from HD | Read filesystem block |
| 04 | Send FSB to PC | Transfer FSB to PC |
| 05 | Rcv FSB from PC | Receive FSB from PC |
| 06 | Write FSB to HD | Write filesystem block |
| 07 | Load HD to Memory | Load file into KN5000 RAM |

| 10 | Rcv data from PC | Receive data from PC |
| 11 | Save memory to HD | Save RAM contents to file |
| 16 | Delete files | Remove files from disk |
| 17 | Format HD | Low-level disk format |
| 18 | Switch HD-motor off | Spin down drive motor |

## PC Parallel Port Protocol

The HD-TechManager5000 Windows software (ppkn50.dll) communicates with the HDAE5000 using a bidirectional parallel port protocol. This section documents the low-level handshaking derived from disassembly of ppkn50.dll.

### Parallel Port Mode: PS/2 Bidirectional

The protocol requires **PS/2 bidirectional mode** (also called "byte mode"), **not** SPP nibble mode, EPP, or ECP.

#### Why not SPP nibble mode?

On a pure unidirectional SPP port, the standard way to receive data from a peripheral is **nibble mode**: the peripheral puts 4 bits on the status lines (base+1, bits 3--7), the PC reads them, then the peripheral sends the other 4 bits --- two reads per byte through the status port.

The ppkn50.dll does **not** use nibble mode. The receive-byte function (at address `0x10001360` in ppkn50.dll) reads data from `base+0` (the data port) via a single `in (%dx), %al` instruction at address `0x1000142A`, after setting control bit 5 to switch the data bus direction. There is no status-port bit shifting, no two-nibble reassembly --- it's a direct 8-bit read from the data port.

#### Why not EPP or ECP?

EPP adds hardware-handshaked registers at base+3 (address) and base+4 (data). ECP adds DMA and FIFO registers. The ppkn50.dll **never accesses** any port beyond base+0, base+1, and base+2. All handshaking is software-driven (strobe/busy polling).

#### Evidence from ppkn50.dll binary

The send-byte and receive-byte functions explicitly switch the data port direction via control register bit 5:

**Send byte** (ppkn50.dll address `0x100011E0`):
```asm
100011f0:  ec              in     (%dx),%al      ; read control (base+2)
100011f1:  24 5e           and    $0x5e,%al      ; clear bit 5 (output mode) + bit 0 + bit 7
100011f3:  ee              out    %al,(%dx)      ; write control
100011f8:  8a 45 0c        mov    0xc(%ebp),%al  ; load data byte
100011fb:  ee              out    %al,(%dx)      ; write to data port (base+0)
```

**Receive byte** (ppkn50.dll address `0x10001360`):
```asm
10001372:  ec              in     (%dx),%al      ; read control (base+2)
10001373:  0c a1           or     $0xa1,%al      ; set bit 5 (input mode) + bit 0 + bit 7
10001375:  ee              out    %al,(%dx)      ; write control
    ; ... poll status bit 7, wait for data ready ...
1000142a:  ec              in     (%dx),%al      ; read data port (base+0)
```

The `AND $0x5E` clears bit 5 (switch to output), the `OR $0xA1` sets bit 5 (switch to input). This is the defining characteristic of PS/2 bidirectional mode. A pure SPP port ignores bit 5, and reading base+0 returns the output latch --- which would corrupt received data.

**Direction switching summary:**

| Control bit 5 | Data port (base+0) | Operation |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 0 (cleared) | Output | PC writes data to HDAE5000 |
| 1 (set) | Input | PC reads data from HDAE5000 |

**Compatibility:** A PC with only unidirectional SPP (no PS/2 bidirectional support) will **not** work with TechManager5000 --- data reads will return the output latch value instead of the HDAE5000's data. The PC must have at least a PS/2-compatible parallel port (standard on PCs from 1987 onwards).

**MAME emulation note:** MAME's `pc_lpt_device` required a fix to support PS/2 bidirectional mode. The original `data_r()` implementation always returned `m_data & peripheral_data` (SPP pull-up behavior), which masks out peripheral data bits wherever the output latch has zeros. For example, after sending byte 0x01 and switching to input mode, only bit 0 of the peripheral's response would be visible. The fix (March 2026, branch `kn5000_research_techmanager`) checks the inverted control bit 5 and returns pure peripheral data when bidirectional mode is active.

### Physical Interface

**PC Parallel Port (PS/2 Bidirectional):**

| Port Address | Register | Direction | Function |
|--------------|----------|-----------|----------|
| base+0 (0x378) | Data | Bidirectional | 8-bit data byte (direction controlled by ctrl bit 5) |
| base+1 (0x379) | Status | Input | Status signals from HDAE5000 |
| base+2 (0x37A) | Control | Output | Control signals to HDAE5000 (bit 5 = direction) |

**HDAE5000 PPI (Intel 8255 at 0x160000):**

| Address | Port | Direction | Function |
|---------|------|-----------|----------|
| 0x160000 | Port A | Bidirectional | Data byte to/from PC |
| 0x160002 | Port B | Input | Status from PC |
| 0x160004 | Port C | Output | Control signals to PC |

### Status Port Bits (base+1)

| Bit | Name | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|

| 6 | ACK | Acknowledge signal |
| 4 | SELECT | HDAE5000 online indicator |
| 3 | ERROR | Error condition |

**Note:** Bit 7 (BUSY) is inverted in hardware by the PC parallel port. The ppkn50.dll XORs with 0x80 after reading to compensate.

### Control Port Bits (base+2)

| Bit | Name | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| 3 | SELECT_IN | Select printer |
| 2 | INIT | Initialize/reset |

### Byte Transfer Handshaking

**Send Byte to HDAE5000:**

```
PC                          HDAE5000
 |                              |
 |-- Write Data to Data Port -->|
 |-- Assert Strobe (bit 1) ---->|
 |                              |
 |<---- BUSY goes LOW ----------|  (data received)
 |                              |
 |-- Deassert Strobe ---------->|
 |                              |
 |<---- BUSY goes HIGH ---------|  (ready for next)
```

**Receive Byte from HDAE5000:**

```
PC                          HDAE5000
 |                              |
 |<---- BUSY goes LOW ----------|  (data available)
 |                              |
 |-- Read Data from Data Port --|
 |-- Assert ACK (bit 1) ------->|
 |                              |
 |<---- BUSY goes HIGH ---------|  (acknowledged)
 |                              |
 |-- Deassert ACK ------------->|
```

### Timeout Values

- **Byte transfer timeout**: 10,000ms (0x2710)
- **Polling iterations**: 512 before time check
- **Connection test retries**: 5 times with 1000ms delay

### DLL Exported Functions

The ppkn50.dll exports these functions for PC applications:

| Function | Command | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `InitializeTheDllPP50` | - | Initialize DLL |
| `OpenThePortNumberPP50` | - | Select LPT port (1-3) |
| `CloseThePortPP50` | - | Close parallel port |
| `TestTheKNPPPP50` | 0x01 | Test connection |

## RAM Variables

Key RAM locations used by disk routines:

| Address | Name | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| 0x229D90 | HD_STATUS_FLAG | Current drive status |
| 0x229D92 | HD_RESULT_FLAG | Last operation result |
| 0x229D99-0x229DAE | HD_CONFIG | Drive configuration flags |
| 0x229DC8 | HD_CONTROL | Control register shadow |
| 0x229DD9 | HD_ENABLE | Drive enabled flag |
| 0x230EDA | HDAE5000_INIT_FLAG | 0=no HD, non-zero=HD present |

## Design Considerations

### Why CHS Instead of LBA?

The HDAE5000 uses CHS (Cylinder/Head/Sector) addressing rather than the newer LBA (Logical Block Addressing). This was common for drives of this era (1996) and provides:
- Direct physical addressing
- Compatibility with older drive firmware
- Simpler sector calculation

### Drive Protection

The firmware includes protective features:
- **Motor timeout**: Spins down drive during inactivity
- **No real-time playback**: Files must be loaded to RAM first
- **Verification**: Reads back written data to confirm

### Sector Size

Standard 512-byte sectors are used, as indicated by the `hddscby` (sector bytes) debug string.

## Emulation Considerations

For MAME emulation, the HDAE5000 disk interface requires:

1. **Direct ATA Register Mapping**: ATA registers at 0x130010-0x130020
   - Data register (16-bit): 0x130010
   - Command block registers (8-bit): 0x130012-0x13001E
   - Device Control (8-bit): 0x130020
2. **PPI Emulation**: Full 8255 PPI at 0x160000 for PC communication (not for IDE)
3. **IDE Drive Model**: CHS-addressed IDE drive simulation
4. **Status Bits**: Proper BSY/DRDY/DRQ/ERR flag handling
5. **PIO Mode**: All transfers are PIO (no DMA observed)
6. **Custom Filesystem**: FSB/FGB/FEB structure parsing

## Verified Implementation Details

The following details were confirmed through firmware analysis:

- **Base Address**: ATA registers start at 0x130010, not 0x130000
- **Transfer Mode**: All data transfers use PIO mode via 16-bit Data register
- **Sector Size**: 512 bytes (256 word transfers)
- **Addressing**: CHS mode only (no LBA observed)
- **Timeout**: Drive ready timeout uses 0x3FFFFF (~4M) iteration loop
- **Status Polling**: Firmware polls Status register in tight loops (no interrupts)

## Further Research

Areas requiring additional investigation:
- Filesystem structure details (FSB/FGB/FEB layout)
- Error recovery procedures
- Exact timing requirements for real hardware

**Completed:**
- PC parallel port protocol details (documented above from ppkn50.dll analysis)
