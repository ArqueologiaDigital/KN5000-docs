# KN5000 App Loader

The App Loader is a generic program launcher for the KN5000 keyboard. It replaces the HDAE5000 extension ROM with a custom loader that reads applications from a FAT16 hard disk, presents a menu, and launches selected apps into RAM. This enables running multiple homebrew programs without reflashing the extension ROM.

*The Mines game running after being loaded from disk by the App Loader. The game binary was read from the FAT16 filesystem, loaded into RAM at 0x208000, and launched via its entry point.*

## Where the Source Lives

The App Loader and the applications built for it live in two repositories that are separate from
the MAME driver tree and the disassembly tree:

| Component | Repository-relative path |
|---|---|
| App Loader firmware (C + `startup.s`) | `custom-kn5000-roms/apploader/src/`, `custom-kn5000-roms/apploader/startup.s` |
| App Loader linker script | `custom-kn5000-roms/apploader/kn5000.ld` |
| Disk-image builder | `custom-kn5000-roms/apploader/tools/create_disk.py` |
| Built extension ROM (512 KB) and disk image | written by `make` into `custom-kn5000-roms/apploader/build/` as `apploader.bin` and `apploader_disk.hd` |
| Mines disk startup and linker script | `Mines/platforms/kn5000/disk_startup.s`, `Mines/platforms/kn5000/disk.ld` (branch `kn5000_port`) |

Paths in the rest of this page are relative to those two repository roots.

## How It Works

The App Loader is an [HDAE5000 extension ROM]({{ site.baseurl }}/hdae5000-homebrew/) that implements:

1. **ATA/IDE disk driver** -- reads sectors from the hard disk attached to the HDAE5000 extension board
2. **FAT16 filesystem driver** -- navigates directories and reads files from a standard FAT16 partition
3. **Application scanner** -- finds apps in the `/APPS/` directory by reading their `APP.INI` manifests
4. **Menu UI** -- displays a list of available apps with name, version, and author
5. **Program loader** -- loads the selected app's `APP.BIN` into RAM and transfers control to it

### Architecture

```
Extension ROM (512KB @ 0x280000)         Hard Disk (FAT16)
+---------------------------+            +------------------+
| App Loader firmware       |            | /APPS/           |
| - XAPR header             |   ATA/IDE  |   /HELLO/        |
| - IDE driver              | <--------> |     APP.INI      |
| - FAT16 driver            |            |     APP.BIN      |
| - Menu UI                 |            |   /MINES/        |
| - Program loader          |            |     APP.INI      |
+---------------------------+            |     APP.BIN      |
                                         +------------------+
        |
        | loads APP.BIN to RAM
        v
Extension DRAM (512KB @ 0x200000)
+---------------------------+
| 0x200000: Loader state    |
| 0x208000: App code/data   |  <-- APP.BIN loaded here
| 0x27F000: App stack top   |
+---------------------------+
```

### Cooperative Multitasking

The KN5000 firmware runs at 60Hz. The App Loader (and any loaded app) must cooperate with the firmware by yielding control every frame. This is done via a coroutine mechanism:

1. **Firmware** calls the App Loader's `Frame_Handler` once per frame
2. **App Loader** resumes the running app by restoring its saved stack pointer
3. **Running app** calls `yield_to_firmware()` to return control until the next frame
4. This cycle repeats at 60Hz, giving each party time to run

The loaded app's `yield_to_firmware()` uses the **same shared addresses** as the App Loader -- `SAVED_SP` at 0x200044 and `APP_SAVED_SP` at 0x200048, declared in both `custom-kn5000-roms/apploader/startup.s` and `custom-kn5000-roms/apploader/src/kn5000.h`. That makes one coroutine chain: Firmware <-> App Loader <-> Running App.

## Creating an Application

Each application lives in its own subdirectory under `/APPS/` on the disk and contains two files:

```
/APPS/MYAPP/
    APP.INI     -- Application manifest (text file)
    APP.BIN     -- Application binary (flat binary, loaded to RAM)
```

### APP.INI Manifest Format

The manifest is a plain text file with `KEY=VALUE` pairs, one per line:

```ini
NAME=My Application
VERSION=1.0
AUTHOR=Your Name
LOAD_ADDR=0x208000
ENTRY_OFFSET=0x0000
STACK_TOP=0x27F000
```

| Field | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `NAME` | Yes | -- | Display name shown in the menu (max ~30 chars) |
| `VERSION` | No | (empty) | Version string shown next to the name |
| `AUTHOR` | No | (empty) | Author name shown below the app name |
| `LOAD_ADDR` | No | 0x208000 | RAM address where APP.BIN is loaded |
| `ENTRY_OFFSET` | No | 0x0000 | Offset from LOAD_ADDR to the entry point |
| `STACK_TOP` | No | 0x27F000 | Initial stack pointer for the app |

Lines starting with `#` or `;` are treated as comments.

### Memory Map for Apps

```
0x200000 +------------------+
         | Loader state     |  (don't touch: loader variables, buffers)
0x208000 +------------------+
         | APP.BIN loaded   |  <-- Your code + read-only data + initialized data
         | here             |
         |                  |
         | (up to ~448KB)   |
         |                  |
0x278000 +------------------+
         | (gap)            |
0x27F000 +------------------+
         | Stack (grows     |  <-- SP starts here
         | downward)        |
         +------------------+
```

Your app has approximately 448KB of contiguous RAM for code, data, and BSS. The stack grows downward from 0x27F000. Do not write to addresses below 0x208000 (that's the App Loader's state).

### Startup Assembly

Your app needs a small assembly startup that:
1. Saves the App Loader's stack pointer (so you can return to it)
2. Switches to your own stack
3. Clears BSS (uninitialized globals)
4. Calls your C `main()` function
5. On return, restores the caller's stack and returns

Here is a minimal startup, as used by the Mines port (`Mines/platforms/kn5000/disk_startup.s`):

```asm
.equ SAVED_SP,        0x200044    ; Firmware SP (shared with App Loader)
.equ APP_SAVED_SP,    0x200048    ; App SP (shared with App Loader)
.equ CALLER_SAVED_SP, 0x207FF0    ; Where we save App Loader's SP
.equ STACK_TOP,       0x27F000    ; Our stack

.globl _start
.globl yield_to_firmware

.section .startup, "ax", @progbits
_start:
        ; Save App Loader's stack pointer
        ld      xwa, xsp
        ld      (CALLER_SAVED_SP), xwa

        ; Switch to our own stack
        ld      xsp, STACK_TOP

        ; Clear BSS
        call    Clear_C_BSS

        ; Run the application
        call    main

        ; Restore App Loader's stack and return
        ld      xwa, (CALLER_SAVED_SP)
        ld      xsp, xwa
        ret

; Yield control back to firmware until next frame.
; Call this in your main loop to keep the system responsive.
yield_to_firmware:
        push    xwa
        push    xbc
        push    xde
        push    xhl
        push    xix
        push    xiy
        push    xiz
        ld      xwa, xsp
        ld      (APP_SAVED_SP), xwa     ; Save our SP
        ld      xwa, (SAVED_SP)         ; Load firmware SP
        ld      xsp, xwa
        pop     xiz
        pop     xiy
        pop     xix
        pop     xhl
        pop     xde
        pop     xbc
        pop     xwa
        ret                             ; Return to firmware

Clear_C_BSS:
        push    xwa
        push    xbc
        push    xde
        ld      xwa, __bss_start
        ld      xbc, __bss_size
        ld      xde, 0
        cp      xbc, 0
        jr      z, .Ldone
.Lloop: ld      (xwa), xde
        add     xwa, 4
        sub     xbc, 4
        jr      nz, .Lloop
.Ldone: pop     xde
        pop     xbc
        pop     xwa
        ret
```

### Linker Script

Use this linker script (`Mines/platforms/kn5000/disk.ld`) to place everything at the correct RAM address:

```
MEMORY {
  APP (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x208000, LENGTH = 448K
}

ENTRY(_start)

SECTIONS {
  .startup 0x208000 : { *(.startup) } > APP
  .text    : { *(.text*) } > APP
  .rodata  : { *(.rodata*) } > APP
  .data    : {
    __data_start = .;
    *(.data*)
    . = ALIGN(4);
    __data_end = .;
  } > APP

  __data_load = __data_start;
  __data_size = 0;  /* No ROM-to-RAM copy needed */

  .bss (NOLOAD) : {
    __bss_start = .;
    *(.bss*)
    *(COMMON)
    . = ALIGN(4);
    __bss_end = .;
  } > APP

  __bss_size = __bss_end - __bss_start;

  /DISCARD/ : { *(.comment) *(.note*) *(.eh_frame*) }
}
```

Since the entire binary is loaded directly to its runtime address by the App Loader, there is no ROM-to-RAM data copy needed (`__data_size = 0`).

### C Code Structure

Your C code should follow this pattern:

```c
/* Declare yield_to_firmware (defined in assembly) */
extern void yield_to_firmware(void);

/* VRAM base address */
#define VRAM_BASE 0x1A0000

/* Your main function */
int main(void)
{
    /* Initialize your app (clear screen, set palette, etc.) */

    /* Main loop */
    while (1) {
        /* Handle input */

        /* Update game state */

        /* Render to VRAM */

        /* IMPORTANT: yield to firmware every frame */
        yield_to_firmware();
    }

    /* Return to App Loader menu */
    return 0;
}
```

The call to `yield_to_firmware()` is essential -- it returns control to the KN5000 firmware for one frame (~16.7ms at 60Hz). Without it, the firmware will hang and the keyboard will be unresponsive.

### Makefile

Here is a template Makefile for building a disk app:

```makefile
LLVM_BIN := /path/to/llvm-project/build/bin
CLANG := $(LLVM_BIN)/clang
LLC := $(LLVM_BIN)/llc
OBJCOPY := $(LLVM_BIN)/llvm-objcopy
LLVM_LINK := $(LLVM_BIN)/llvm-link
LLD := $(LLVM_BIN)/ld.lld
LLD_ENV := LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(LLVM_BIN)/../lib

BUILD_DIR := build

CFLAGS := -target tlcs900 -ffreestanding -nostdlib -O2 -Iinclude
LLC_FLAGS := -mtriple=tlcs900 -mcpu=tmp94c241 -O2

# Compile C to LLVM IR
$(BUILD_DIR)/%.ll: %.c | $(BUILD_DIR)
	$(CLANG) $(CFLAGS) -S -emit-llvm -o $@ $<

# Link IR modules
$(BUILD_DIR)/all_c.ll: $(BUILD_DIR)/main.ll
	$(LLVM_LINK) -S -o $@ $^

# Compile IR to object
$(BUILD_DIR)/all_c.o: $(BUILD_DIR)/all_c.ll
	$(LLC) $(LLC_FLAGS) -filetype=obj -o $@ $<

# Assemble startup
$(BUILD_DIR)/startup.o: disk_startup.s | $(BUILD_DIR)
	$(CLANG) -target tlcs900 -mcpu=tmp94c241 -c -o $@ $<

# Link
$(BUILD_DIR)/app.elf: $(BUILD_DIR)/startup.o $(BUILD_DIR)/all_c.o disk.ld
	$(LLD_ENV) $(LLD) -T disk.ld -o $@ $(BUILD_DIR)/startup.o $(BUILD_DIR)/all_c.o

# Extract flat binary
$(BUILD_DIR)/APP.BIN: $(BUILD_DIR)/app.elf
	$(OBJCOPY) -O binary $< $@

$(BUILD_DIR):
	mkdir -p $@

.PHONY: clean
clean:
	rm -rf $(BUILD_DIR)
```

## Building the Disk Image

Applications are distributed on a FAT16 hard disk image. The App Loader includes a Python script, `custom-kn5000-roms/apploader/tools/create_disk.py`, that creates a properly formatted disk image.

### Disk Image Structure

```
Sector 0:     MBR (Master Boot Record with partition table)
Sector 1+:    FAT16 partition
              +-- Boot sector (BPB)
              +-- FAT tables (x2)
              +-- Root directory
              +-- Data area
                  +-- /APPS/ directory
                      +-- /APPS/HELLO/APP.INI, APP.BIN
                      +-- /APPS/MINES/APP.INI, APP.BIN
                      +-- /APPS/MYAPP/APP.INI, APP.BIN
```

### Adding Your App to the Disk

To add a new application to the disk image, modify `custom-kn5000-roms/apploader/tools/create_disk.py`. Follow the pattern used for HELLO and MINES:

1. Create a subdirectory cluster under `/APPS/`
2. Write the `APP.INI` manifest
3. Write the `APP.BIN` binary

Or, for simpler workflows, mount the raw disk image and copy files directly:

```bash
# Mount the raw image (Linux, requires root)
sudo mount -o loop,offset=512 build/apploader_disk.img /mnt/disk
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/disk/APPS/MYAPP
sudo cp APP.INI /mnt/disk/APPS/MYAPP/
sudo cp build/APP.BIN /mnt/disk/APPS/MYAPP/
sudo umount /mnt/disk
```

Note: The offset of 512 skips the MBR sector to reach the FAT16 partition.

## Testing in MAME

### Prerequisites

- MAME with the KN5000 driver (including HDAE5000 extension slot and ATA support)
- Original KN5000 ROM dumps
- The App Loader ROM: the 512 KB `apploader.bin` that `make romset` writes into `custom-kn5000-roms/apploader/build/`
- A disk image with your app: `apploader_disk.hd`, in the same build directory

### Building Everything

```bash
cd custom-kn5000-roms/apploader

# Build the App Loader ROM and disk image
make all

# This produces:
#   build/apploader.bin       -- Extension ROM (512KB)
#   build/apploader_disk.hd   -- FAT16 disk image (~16MB)
#   custom_kn5000_roms/apploader/kn5000/  -- Complete MAME ROM set
```

### Running MAME

**Interactive mode** (recommended for development):

```bash
make test-interactive
```

This runs MAME with the App Loader ROM in the HDAE5000 extension slot and the disk image attached as an IDE hard drive.

**Automated mode** (for CI/testing):

```bash
make test
```

This runs MAME for 120 seconds with `-skip_gameinfo` to bypass startup dialogs.

The underlying MAME command is:

```bash
mame kn5000 \
    -rompath /path/to/custom_kn5000_roms/apploader \
    -extension hdae5000 \
    -hard build/apploader_disk.hd \
    -window -ui_active -oslog
```

### Activating the App Loader

The App Loader activates when the firmware sends the DISK MENU event (`0x01C00008`). In MAME:

1. Wait for the keyboard to boot (~30 seconds)
2. Press the **`MENU: DISK`** button (`CPR_SEG10` `0x20`) — that is the name it carries in
   MAME's input list
3. The App Loader menu should appear on the LCD

For automated testing via Lua scripts, you can force activation by writing directly to the loader's active flag:

```lua
-- Write 1 to LOADER_ACTIVE (0x200000) after firmware boots
local cpu = manager.machine.devices[":maincpu"]
local mem = cpu.spaces["program"]
mem:write_u8(0x200000, 1)
```

### Menu Navigation

The loader reads the panel's raw scan bytes, so the keys it watches are named after their
matrix position rather than after the function they serve here:

| Bit read by the loader | Panel button in MAME | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `CPR_SEG4` `0x02` | `RIGHT 2` (PART SELECT) | Move selection up |
| `CPR_SEG4` `0x20` | `CONDUCTOR: RIGHT 2` | Move selection down |
| `CPL_SEG4` `0x01` | `VARIATION 1` | Launch the selected app |
| `CPL_SEG7` `0x08` | `EXIT` | Leave the App Loader |

### Disk Image Format

The App Loader requires a **raw disk image** with `.hd` extension. CHD (Compressed Hunks of Data) format does not work correctly with the HDAE5000 ATA device -- MAME returns raw CHD header bytes instead of decompressed sector data. Always use raw images.

## Worked Example: Mines Game

Mines (Minesweeper) is a full application that runs under the App Loader. It is built in three steps.

### 1. Build the Mines disk binary

```bash
cd Mines/platforms/kn5000   # branch kn5000_port
make disk
# Produces: build/mines_disk.bin (14KB)
```

This builds Mines with a disk-specific startup (`Mines/platforms/kn5000/disk_startup.s`) and linker script (`Mines/platforms/kn5000/disk.ld`) that target RAM at 0x208000 instead of the extension ROM address.

### 2. Create the disk image

```bash
cd custom-kn5000-roms/apploader
make disk
# Produces: build/apploader_disk.hd with /APPS/MINES/APP.BIN
```

`create_disk.py` looks for the `mines_disk.bin` that `make disk` leaves in `Mines/platforms/kn5000/build/`, and when it is present writes it into the image as `/APPS/MINES/APP.BIN`.

### 3. Run in MAME

```bash
make test-interactive
# Boot the keyboard, press DISK, navigate to Mines, press ENTER
```

### How the Mines Port Fits the Loader

- **Shared coroutine addresses**: The Mines game's `yield_to_firmware()` uses the same SAVED_SP/APP_SAVED_SP addresses (0x200044/0x200048) as the App Loader, so the firmware does not distinguish between the App Loader and the Mines game -- both participate in the same cooperative multitasking scheme.

- **No XAPR header**: Unlike the extension ROM approach, disk apps don't need an XAPR header. They're plain flat binaries loaded to RAM.

- **Self-contained binary**: The disk binary includes all code, read-only data (tiles, palette), and initialized data in a single flat binary. BSS is zeroed by the startup code.

## Source Code

The App Loader source code is available at:

- **App Loader**: [`custom-kn5000-roms/apploader/`](https://github.com/ArqueologiaDigital/custom-kn5000-roms/tree/main/apploader)
- **Mines disk build**: [`Mines/platforms/kn5000/`](https://github.com/ArqueologiaDigital/Mines/tree/kn5000_port/platforms/kn5000) (see `disk_startup.s`, `disk.ld`, and the `disk` Makefile target)
