# Timer 4/5 and the Sequencer Clock

The KN5000 firmware paces its sequencer, metronome and demo-song cycling from the TMP94C241's
**Timer 4/5** pair. This page states how the firmware programs it, what the chip does on a
compare match, and which parts of that the MAME core models.

## How the Firmware Programs It

```
Timer 4 (16-bit up counter UC4)
  ├── TREG4 (low compare register)  → INTTR4 on match
  └── TREG5 (high compare register) → INTTR5 on match + counter reset

T4FFCR (flip-flop control register)
  ├── Bit 2: invert the flip-flop on a TREG4 match
  └── Bit 3: invert the flip-flop on a TREG5 match
```

Boot (`v10/maincpu/shared/boot_hw_init.s:76-82`) starts **only timer 4** (T16RUN bit 0) with
`T4MOD = 0x05`, `TREG4 = 1` and `TREG5 = 0x3D09`, and sets up the interrupts:

| Interrupt | Priority | Handler |
|---|---|---|
| INTTR5 | 3 (enabled) | `0xEF086A` |
| INTTR4 | 0 (disabled) | `0xEF0E21` |

TREG5 is therefore the interval register, and **INTTR5 is the sequencer clock**. Its handler
drives the tick counters at DRAM 1047, 1051 and 1052, which pace the accompaniment engine, the
metronome and demo song cycling. If INTTR5 does not fire, demo songs never advance.

## What a Compare Match Does

Three things are independent, and the emulation keeps them independent:

| On match | Condition |
|---|---|
| Raise the interrupt flag — `0x80` (INTTR5) for TREG_HIGH, `0x08` (INTTR4) for TREG_LOW | always |
| Reset the up counter (TREG_HIGH only) | always, given `T4MOD` bit 2 (`CLE`) set |
| Invert the timer flip-flop | only if the matching `T4FFCR` bit is set |

The `T4FFCR` bits gate **only** the flip-flop. They must not gate the interrupt or the counter
reset — that is what the 8-bit timers in the same file have always done, and the 16-bit path
matches them. TREG_HIGH must raise the upper flag (`0x80`), not the lower one.

## Two Documented Gaps in the 16-Bit Path

`timer_16bits` in `src/devices/cpu/tlcs900/tmp94c241.cpp` deliberately leaves two datasheet
behaviours unmodelled. The sibling `tmp95c061.cpp` implements both in its `run16()` lambda;
port that if a driver ever needs them.

1. **`CLE` is assumed set.** `T4MOD`/`T5MOD` bit 2 chooses whether a TREG_HIGH match clears the
   up counter; `CLE = 0` means a free-running counter. The code always clears.
2. **The two comparators are chained, not independent.** The `else if` means that when
   TREG_LOW and TREG_HIGH hold the same value the lower interrupt can never be raised.

Neither is observable on any Technics machine: the KN5000 sets `T4MOD` bit 2, so (1) is moot,
and `TREG4 = 1` against `TREG5 = 0x3D09` are different, so (2) is moot. The Toshiba TMP95C061
databook passages are Figure 3.9 (3) p.95 and section 3.9 (5) p.103; the quotes are
re-checkable with `notes/wsa1-probes/tlcs900_datasheet_quotes.py` in the MAME tree.
