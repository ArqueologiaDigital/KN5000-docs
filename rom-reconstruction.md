# ROM Reconstruction

Goal: Rebuild all firmware ROMs from disassembled source with 100% byte accuracy.

## Firmware Version History

Official firmware updates were distributed on floppy disk. All versions are archived at [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/technics-kn5000-system-update-disks).

### Main Board Firmware

| Version | Release Date | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| v5 | 1997-11-12 | Earliest available |
| v6 | 1998-01-16 | |
| v7 | 1998-06-26 | |
| v8 | 1998-11-13 | |
| v9 | 1999-01-26 | |
| **v10** | 1999-08-02 | **Current disassembly target** |

### HD-AE5000 Firmware

| Version | Release Date | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| v1.10i | 1998-07-06 | Initial release |
| v1.15i | 1998-10-13 | |
| v2.0i | 1999-01-15 | Added lyrics display |

## Current Status

| ROM | Size | Match % | Bytes Off | Source File |
|-----|------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Main CPU | 2MB | 99.96% | 893* | `maincpu/kn5000_v10_program.asm` |
| Sub CPU Payload | 192KB | **100%** | 0 | `subcpu/kn5000_subprogram_v142.asm` |
| Sub CPU Boot | 128KB | - | - | No source yet |
| Table Data | 2MB | 32.42% | 1,417,294 | `table_data/kn5000_table_data.asm` |
| Custom Data | 1MB | - | - | No source yet |
| HDAE5000 (HD Expansion) | 512KB | - | - | No source yet |

## Assembler

The project uses **ASL (Alfred Arnold's Macro Assembler)** version 1.42 Beta.

**Challenge**: ASL only supports TMP96C141, not TMP94C241F. Unsupported instructions are handled via macros in `tmp94c241.inc` that emit raw byte sequences.

## Known Divergences

### Main CPU (893 bytes*)

*\*716 bytes are from a recent palette binclude regression (issue kn5000-prgr). The palette data at 0xEB37DE was replaced with a binary include, but this unexpectedly affected data at 0xEEFB0C near the second palette area. Investigation in progress.*

**Original 177 bytes**: Various instruction encoding issues being cataloged.

**Regression (+716 bytes)**: Caused by removing inline `dd LABEL_*` statements from palette data where label addresses (0xFF0000, 0xFFFF00, etc.) coincidentally matched color values.

### Table Data (67.58% incorrect)

This ROM contains mostly binary data (images, sound samples, lookup tables). The divergences are likely due to:
- Missing or incorrect binary includes
- Endianness issues in data definitions

## Technical Notes

### TMP94C241F vs TMP96C141

Instructions unique to TMP94C241F that require macro workarounds:
- Memory-to-memory `LD` (not supported by TLCS-900)
- Certain shift/rotate variants
- Some MUL/DIV variants
- LDI, LDIR, LDD, LDDR block transfer instructions

### Build Process

```bash
cd kn5000-roms-disasm
make all              # Build all ROMs
python compare_roms.py # Verify against originals
```
