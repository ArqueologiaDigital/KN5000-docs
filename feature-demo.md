# Feature Demo & Presentation System

The KN5000 firmware contains a **full XML-based presentation scripting system** used for the built-in Feature Demo. This system is significantly more sophisticated than a simple slideshow — it includes an XML parser, an event-driven presentation controller, and a rich tag vocabulary suggesting it was designed for general-purpose use.

## SSF Presentation Format

### Files in Table Data ROM

Two SSF (presumably "Show/Script/Sequence File") files are embedded in the Table Data ROM:

| File | ROM Address | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `hkst_55.ssf` | 0x87FFF0 (metadata), 0x88000E (XML data) | Feature Demo presentation script |
| `hkt_87.ssf` | Near boot vectors (table_data.asm line 3855) | Unknown — possibly a second presentation |

**Source file:** `../../kn5000-roms-disasm/table_data/includes/hkst_55.ssf`

### XML Format

The Feature Demo script is real XML with a defined structure:

```xml
<ACTION>
  <ACT NO=1><SHOW OBJ="ftdemo01"></ACT>
  <ACT NO=2><SHOW OBJ="ftdemo04"></ACT>
  <ACT NO=3><SHOW OBJ="ftdemo05"></ACT>
  ...
  <ACT NO=27><SHOW OBJ="ftdemo48"></ACT>
</ACTION>
```

The script defines 27 sequential actions, each referencing a named UI object. Objects include `ftdemo01`–`ftdemo48` plus instrument-specific displays like `Accordion`, `Drawbar`, and `Sdmixer`.

---

## XML Tag Vocabulary

The firmware contains a complete XML tag name table at approximately line 87475 of the Program ROM disassembly (`kn5000_v10_program.asm`):

### Structure Tags

| Tag | Close Tag | Purpose |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| `PRESENTATION` | `/PRESENTATION` | Top-level presentation wrapper |
| `ACTION` | `/ACTION` | Action sequence container |
| `ACT` | `/ACT` | Individual action step (with `NO=` attribute) |

### Content Tags

| Tag | Close Tag | Purpose |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| `SHOW` | — | Show/display a named UI object |
| `IMG` | — | Display an image |
| `SONG` | — | Play a song or MIDI sequence |
| `FONT` | `/FONT` | Font selection for text rendering |
| `CENTER` | `/CENTER` | Text centering |
| `BR` | — | Line break |

### Attribute Tags

| Tag | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `SRC` | Source reference (file/resource) |
| `NAME` | Name identifier |

### Command Tags

| Tag | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **`EXEC`** | **Execute a command or routine** |

The `EXEC` tag is particularly notable — it strongly suggests the presentation format was designed to support executing code or commands as part of scripted presentations, going beyond simple display and playback.

---

## Presentation Handler Functions

The firmware implements a full event-driven presentation controller:

### Core Handlers

| Function | ROM Address | Line | Purpose |
|----------|-------------|------|---------|
| `AcFdemoScreenProc` | 0xF84149 | 308910 | Feature Demo screen handler |
| `AcPresentationBoxProc` | 0xF842B4 | 309070 | Presentation display widget |
| `AcPresentationControlProc` | 0xF8450B | 309287 | Main presentation controller |
| `IvDemofeature1Proc` | — | ~310702 | Feature Demo event handler 1 |
| `IvDemofeature2Proc` | — | ~310736 | Feature Demo event handler 2 |

`AcPresentationControlProc` is the main dispatch routine. It uses a jump table at `0xE9F9B2` to handle different presentation states/events.

### Event System

The firmware defines dedicated events for presentation processing:

| Event Constant | Line | Purpose |
|----------------|------|---------|
| `EV_READPRESENTATION` | 78181 | Read and parse a presentation file |
| `EV_READACTION` | 78180 | Read and process an action step |
| `EV_READSONG` | 78178 | Load and play a song reference |

These events integrate with the KN5000's broader UI event system (see [UI Framework]({{ site.baseurl }}/ui-framework/)).

---

## Feature Demo Assets

### Bitmap Images (Table Data ROM)

The Feature Demo includes 6 bitmap images stored in Windows BMP format:

| Asset | ROM Address | Size (bytes) | Content |
|-------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| `FTBMP01.BMP` | 0x880418 | 77,878 | Technics logo with world globe |
| `FTBMP02.BMP` | 0x89344E | 42,678 | Subwoofers |
| `FTBMP03.BMP` | 0x89DB04 | 39,478 | Floppy discs |
| `FTBMP04.BMP` | 0x8A753A | 39,478 | Inserting discs |
| `FTBMP05.BMP` | 0x8B0F70 | 41,078 | Surround sound arrows |
| `FTBMP06.BMP` | 0x8BAFE6 | 77,878 | KN5000 name with rainbow comet |

**Total bitmap storage:** 318,468 bytes (~311 KB)

### File Entry Index (0x8CE01C)

The bitmap file entries use a fixed record format:

```
struct FeatureDemo_FileEntry {
    char   filename[12];    // +0x00: null-terminated filename (e.g., "FTBMP01.BMP")
    uint32 reserved;        // +0x0C: always 0
    uint32 data_ptr;        // +0x10: pointer to BMP data in ROM
    uint32 file_size;       // +0x14: size in bytes
};                          // Total: 24 bytes per entry
```

Six entries are stored contiguously at 0x8CE01C, referenced by the metadata header at 0x87FFF0 via `FeatureDemo_FileEntry1`.

### Metadata Header (0x87FFF0)

The presentation file metadata at 0x87FFF0 links the SSF script and asset index:

```
struct FeatureDemo_FileMetadata {
    char   filename[12];    // +0x00: "hkst_55.ssf"
    uint32 reserved;        // +0x0C: 0
    uint32 padding_ptr;     // +0x10: pointer to 2-byte padding (HKstSSF_Padding)
    uint32 xml_ptr;         // +0x14: pointer to XML data (Feature_Demo_XML at 0x88000E)
    uint32 entries_ptr;     // +0x18: pointer to file entries (FeatureDemo_FileEntry1 at 0x8CE01C)
};
```

### UI Objects (Program ROM)

The NAKA UI widget system manages all structured UI elements. See [UI Widget Types]({{ site.baseurl }}/ui-widget-types/) for full documentation of the 9 widget type bytes, structure layouts, and dispatch mechanism.

48 named UI objects are referenced in the Program ROM:

- `ftdemo01` through `ftdemo48` — bitmap resource names (aligned strings at lines 6240-6648)
- `Accordion` — accordion register display (container object with sub-objects: `Accordion1`, `Accordion2`, `AcAccordionTab`)
- `Drawbar` — digital drawbar organ display (container with `IvDrawbar1`, `IvDrawbar2`, `AcDrawbarName`)
- `Sdmixer` — sound/sequencer mixer display (container with child parameter structures)

The `ftdemo01`–`ftdemo48` names are **bitmap resource references**, not complex widget structures. They are simple filename strings (e.g., `aligned_string "ftdemo43"`) that identify image resources loaded during the demo.

The interactive objects (`Accordion`, `Drawbar`, `Sdmixer`) are **container objects** with child sub-objects, handler procedures, and rendering routines spanning hundreds of lines each:

| Object | Handler | Code Location |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| Accordion | `IvAccordionProc` | Lines 257980-258362 |
| Drawbar | `IvDrawbarProc` | Lines 262262-264436 |
| Sdmixer | (TT_SDMIXER) | Line 45566 |

### Object Dispatch Architecture

When `AcPresentationControlProc` (0xF8450B) processes a `<SHOW OBJ="...">` action:

1. The XML parser extracts the OBJ name string
2. The name is matched against the resource/object name table
3. For bitmap resources (ftdemo01-48): loads the image and renders to VRAM
4. For container objects (Accordion, Drawbar, Sdmixer): activates the interactive UI handler

The dispatch uses a **jump table at 0xE9F9B2** indexed by event type:
- Event codes 0x1C00002 through 0x1C0000C branch to specific handlers
- Each handler extracts its object pointer from the workspace and processes render/update/event actions

Handler call pattern:
```
AcPresentationControlProc:
    ; Calculate jump table offset from event code
    sub xbc, 0x1C00002
    add xbc, xbc               ; multiply by 2
    add xbc, 0xE9F9B2          ; jump table base
    ld bc, (xbc)               ; load handler pointer
    ; ... dispatch to handler
```

`AcPresentationBoxProc` (0xF842B4) handles the visual frame rendering, responding to message types 0x1E0003C, 0x1E0003A, 0x1C0001B and calling display routines at 0xFA6266, 0xFA4409.

---

## Demo Mode Handlers (Program ROM)

The Feature Demo uses a multi-mode event-driven architecture with separate handlers for different demo stages:

| Handler | Address | Event | Purpose |
|---------|---------|-------|---------|
| `DemoModeFunc` | `demo_routines.s` | 0x1C00013 | Main demo mode dispatcher (init vs. run) |
| `DemoMenuTtlFunc` | `demo_routines.s` | — | Demo menu title (stub) |
| `DemoStyleTtlFunc` | `demo_routines.s` | 0x1C00007/0x1C00013 | Style selection with encoder/direction input |
| `DemoSoundTtlFunc` | `demo_routines.s` | 0x1C00007/0x1C00013 | Sound selection with encoder/direction input |
| `DemoRhyTtlFunc` | `demo_routines.s` | 0x1C00007/0x1C00013 | Rhythm selection with encoder/direction input |
| `DemoMode_Initialize` | 0xF869E3 | — | First-time demo setup (voice save, audio init) |
| `DemoMode_Main_Operation` | 0xF8696F | — | Main demo playback loop |
| `AcDemoSongBoxProc` | ~line 194533 | — | Song selection display widget |
| `DemoSongSelFunc` | ~line 194728 | — | Song selection handler |
| `AcDemoMedleyDispBoxProc` | ~line 195115 | — | Medley display widget |

Each selection handler (Style/Sound/Rhythm) has a dispatch table and supports three input types:
- **Direction** (up/down): Posts event 0xE2 (style) or 0xE3 (sound/rhythm)
- **Encoder** (rotary): Posts event 0xE2 (rhythm) or 0xE1 (sound) via 0xF99490
- **Enter**: Calls shared handler at 0xF86A47

## No Floppy Loading Path

Despite the sophisticated XML presentation infrastructure, **the current firmware does NOT load SSF files from floppy disc:**

1. **SSF parser reads from hardcoded ROM addresses.** The `AcPresentationControlProc` and related handlers are wired to data in the Table Data ROM (0x800000+), not to a floppy loading pipeline.

2. **No floppy disc type for presentations.** The [disc type signature table]({{ site.baseurl }}/system-update-discs/#disc-type-detection) has 8 entries covering firmware updates, custom data, and HDAE5000 — none for SSF or presentation files.

3. **Floppy I/O handles only data formats.** Beyond system updates, the floppy subsystem handles: MIDI songs (.MID), sequencer tracks (.SQT), styles (.STY), performance memories (.PMT), rhythm data (.RCM) — but NOT SSF presentations.

---

## Bitmap Loading Chain

When `AcPresentationControlProc` processes a `<SHOW OBJ="ftdemo01">` action, the firmware:

1. **Looks up the object name** (`ftdemo01`) in the UI object table (`LABEL_E1344E`, ~141 entries). The corresponding entry is a `FTDEMO_SCREEN*` structure.

2. **Extracts the filename** from the structure — the last field is a `.long` pointer to a null-terminated string like `"FTBMP01"` (stored as `FTDEMO_BMP01_TECHNICS_GLOBE`).

3. **Looks up the filename** in the file entry index at `0x8CE01C` (Table Data ROM). The index stores 6 entries of 24 bytes each:

   ```c
   struct FeatureDemo_FileEntry {
       char   filename[12];  // "FTBMP01.BMP"
       uint32 reserved;      // 0
       uint32 data_ptr;      // ROM address (e.g. 0x880418)
       uint32 file_size;     // in bytes
   };
   ```

4. **Reads the BMP data** directly from the Table Data ROM using the pointer.

5. **Renders to VRAM** (0x1A0000–0x1DFFFF, 256KB) via `VwUserBitmapByNameProc` / `DrawBitmapFile`. The 8-bit BMP palette is loaded to the hardware palette register; pixel data is DMA-copied to the display.

The entire pipeline is **ROM-resident** — no disk I/O occurs for the Feature Demo. The `"FTBMP01"` filename in the `FTDEMO_SCREEN` structure is a logical key, not a filesystem path.

## Button Sequence for Feature Demo

The correct button sequence to activate the Feature Demo from the home screen:

1. Press **DEMO** button → `8D38` transitions from `0x01` (normal) to `0xE0` (DEMONSTRATION menu appears)
2. Press **LEFT 4** (4th from top, CPL_SEG9) → `8D38` transitions to `0xE4` (FEATURE PRESENTATION sub-menu appears)
3. Press **LEFT 2** (CPL_SEG10) → `8D38` transitions to `0xE1` (demonstration/performances begin playing)

### Demo Menu UI States

| State (`0x8D38`) | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `0x01` | Normal operation (home screen) |
| `0xE0` | DEMONSTRATION menu (top-level) |
| `0xE4` | FEATURE PRESENTATION sub-menu |
| `0xE1` | Demonstration/performances playing |

---

## Two Separate Systems in the Feature Demo

The Feature Demo consists of two independent subsystems that operate in parallel:

### 1. Demo Timer System (Song Cycling)

- **Timer variable:** DRAM address `0x0D2F` (3375 decimal)
- **Purpose:** Independent countdown timer that controls song cycling through demo items
- **Entry point:** `Demo_SelectEntry_TimerTick` (0xF86D45), called from the main loop timer
- **MAME status:** **Works correctly** with the tone gen hold timer fix

The Demo Timer System handles the musical demonstration — it sequences through songs, manages auto-play timing, and coordinates playback state transitions. This is the system responsible for the audio content of the Feature Demo.

### 2. SSF Visual Presentation (Bitmap Rendering)

- **Trigger event:** `0x1C00038`
- **Purpose:** Handles FTBMP bitmap rendering — the visual slideshow of images (Technics logo, subwoofers, floppy discs, etc.)
- **Handler:** `GroupBoxProc_StartSSFPresentation` (0xF9A273) — should create workspace with tag `0xB80A` and dispatch to `AcPresentCtrl_CheckSSFStart`
- **MAME status:** **Currently broken** — event `0x1C00038` does not reach `GroupBoxProc_StartSSFPresentation`

The SSF system parses the XML script (`hkst_55.ssf`) and renders the FTBMP bitmap images to VRAM. Without this system working, the demo plays songs but does not display the accompanying visual presentation.

### SSF Gate State 0xE4

The gate table entry for state `0xE4` (FEATURE PRESENTATION sub-menu) contains the **unconditional marker** `0xFFFE`. This means any key press in state `0xE4` should broadcast event `0x1C00038` — the gate is wide open.

### Workspace Tag Mismatch

The root cause of the SSF failure involves a workspace type-tag mismatch between two code paths:

- **`DemoMenu_BuildItemWorkspace`** (0xF83CEA): Creates workspaces with `0x82xx` tags (computed from table at `0xE9F88C` plus a part-select offset). These tags **never** equal `0xB80A`.
- **`AcPresentCtrl_CheckSSFStart`** (0xF84625): Requires workspace tag `0xB80A` to start the SSF presentation.
- **`GroupBoxProc_StartSSFPresentation`** (0xF9A273): Should create the correct `0xB80A` tag, but **never receives event `0x1C00038`** in the current MAME emulation.

The mismatch means that even though `DemoMenu_BuildItemWorkspace` fires event `0x1C0001C` repeatedly (once per menu item), the workspace tag check at `AcPresentCtrl_CheckSSFStart` always fails. The correct path requires `GroupBoxProc_StartSSFPresentation` to receive `0x1C00038` first and build the `0xB80A`-tagged workspace, but this event never arrives.

---

## MAME Emulation Status

**Current status (March 2026):** **Partially working.** The Demo Timer System (song cycling) works correctly in MAME — the timer counts down, songs cycle, and `PlaySong` returns after ~16 seconds of SwbtWr buffer processing. The SSF Visual Presentation (FTBMP bitmap rendering) is currently broken — event `0x1C00038` does not reach `GroupBoxProc_StartSSFPresentation`.

**Reference Lua script:** `/tmp/ftdemo_v3.lua` — automated navigation from boot to Feature Demo activation.

---

---

## Workspace Allocation — Concept Explained

Before describing the root cause, it helps to understand what "allocating a workspace" means in the KN5000 firmware's event system.

The KN5000 event system (centered on `SendEvent` at `0xFA9660` and `PostEventWithParam` at `0xFA9D58`) passes three registers as event parameters: XWA (target), XBC (event code), and XDE (data/parameter). For events that need to carry more than a single 32-bit value, the firmware uses a **workspace** pattern:

1. A small block of memory (typically 12 bytes) is allocated from the firmware heap by calling `LABEL_FF0E80` (the workspace allocator). The returned pointer is stored in DRAM (usually somewhere in `0x000000–0x0FFFFF`).
2. The workspace fields are populated: the first 4 bytes act as a **type-tag** (a magic 32-bit value identifying the kind of data the workspace carries), followed by payload fields.
3. The workspace **pointer** is passed as XDE when calling `SendEvent` or `PostEventWithParam`.
4. The receiving handler reads the workspace via the pointer, checks the type-tag, and processes the payload.

Think of the workspace as a small heap-allocated struct passed by pointer via the event system.

Because workspaces are allocated from a pool in DRAM and may be reused, it is critical that the event fires and the workspace is consumed **before** the memory is overwritten by another allocation or unrelated code. This is why the two distinct event-dispatch paths (queued vs. direct) produce different results.

---

## Investigation History: How the Solution Was Found

### Two paths for event 0x1C0001C

Deep investigation (Feb 2026, Lua trace scripts + ROM disassembly analysis) identified that there are **two completely different code paths** that send event `0x1C0001C` to `AcPresentationControlProc`:

#### Path 1 — `DemoMenu_BuildItemWorkspace` (0xF83CEA) — QUEUED, WRONG TAG

This function is called in a loop for each of the ~15 demo menu items (styles, sounds, rhythms). For each item it:

1. Allocates a 12-byte workspace via the heap allocator (`FF0E80`).
2. Reads the "part select" index `R` from DRAM address `0x8D3A` via `GetPartSelect()`.
3. Computes `workspace[0..3] = table[0xE9F88C + iz*2] + R*1024`.
   The table (at ROM `0xE9F88C`) holds 16-bit values all in the range `0x82xx–0x82CC`.
   **This formula can never produce the value `0x0000B80A`** for any byte `R`, because the difference `0xB80A − 0x82xx` is never divisible by 1024.
4. Posts event `0x1C0001C` via `PostEventWithParam` (`FA9D58`) — a **queued** (deferred) dispatch.

When this queued event eventually reaches `AcPresentationControlProc` (`0xF8450B`), it is handled by `AcPresentCtrl_CheckSSFStart` (`0xF84625`), which checks `*(XDE) == 0xB80A`. The check **always fails** because the workspace type-tag is never `0xB80A`.

#### Path 2 — `GroupBoxProc_StartSSFPresentation` (0xF9A273) — DIRECT, CORRECT TAG

`GroupBoxProc` (`~0xF998xx`) is a UI container widget handler. Its event dispatch table includes:

```
cp xde, 0x1C00038
jrl z, GroupBoxProc_StartSSFPresentation    ; direct entry

cp xde, 0x1C00030
jrl z, GroupBoxProc_Ev1C00030              ; via show-item handler
```

`GroupBoxProc_StartSSFPresentation` (0xF9A273) builds the workspace bytes **individually** from stack-resident parameters, producing `workspace[0]=0x0A, workspace[1]=0xB8, workspace[2..3]=0x00` — the type-tag `0x0000B80A`. It then sends event `0x1C0001C` via **direct** `SendEvent` (`FA9660`).

When this event reaches `AcPresentCtrl_CheckSSFStart`, the type-tag check **passes**, and the handler sends event `0x1C00006` — which starts SSF presentation parsing, loads the XML from ROM, and begins rendering FTBMP images.

#### Root cause summary (initial hypothesis — superseded)

Initial analysis concluded that `GroupBoxProc_StartSSFPresentation` was never reached via the button-press navigation path tested. Subsequent investigation revealed the correct navigation: pressing **DEMO** (not LEFT 2) in state `0xE4` triggers `GroupBoxProc`'s event handler directly, which calls `GroupBoxProc_StartSSFPresentation` and correctly builds the `0xB80A` workspace tag. See "MAME Emulation Status" above for the confirmed working sequence.

### Call-chain overview

```
Feature Demo activated
  → DemoModeFunc (0xF222CC)  [event 0x1C00013, XDE=1]
    → DemoMode_Initialize (0xF869E3)
    → DemoMode_Main_Operation (0xF8696F)
      → DemoMenu_BuildItemWorkspace (0xF83CEA)  [×15, for each menu item]
        → PostEventWithParam (0xFA9D58)
          → AcPresentCtrl_CheckSSFStart (0xF84625)
            *(workspace) == 0xB80A?  NO → SSF never starts

Expected (but missing in MAME):
  GroupBoxProc receives event 0x1C00038
    → GroupBoxProc_StartSSFPresentation (0xF9A273)
      → SendEvent (0xFA9660) with workspace tag 0x0000B80A
        → AcPresentCtrl_CheckSSFStart
          *(workspace) == 0xB80A?  YES
            → sends 0x1C00006 → SSF parser starts → FTBMP images rendered
```

### Why GroupBoxProc doesn't receive 0x1C00038 in MAME

**Confirmed root cause** (March 2026, MAME Lua trace investigation):

`LABEL_F98697` IS called during boot initialization — approximately 900+ times — but all calls occur when DRAM `0x8D38 = 0x00`. This maps to ROM table entry[0] at `0xE014CE`, which contains the sentinel array `{0xFFFF}` (immediately terminating). Every boot-time call returns immediately with no event sent.

The dispatcher mechanism consists of:
- **FDB3D1** (event buffer writer): fills a circular buffer at DRAM `0xBD3C` with 4-byte entries encoding chain index (`C080`) and param (`C07D`)
- **FDB328/FDB32E** (main dispatcher loop): reads entries from `0xBD3C`, selects handler chains from table `EE7CA7`, calls ALL functions in the selected chain

During boot initialization, FDB3D1 sweeps all chain indices `0x00`→`0x9A` with 24 C07D params each (~4,608 total events). `LABEL_F98697` is invoked for every event whose chain (at `EE7CA7[C080*4]`) includes it. At boot time, `8D38=0x00` → `table[0]={0xFFFF}` → returns early every time.

After boot stabilizes (`8D38` changes to `0x01`), the event buffer at `0xBD3C` drains and FDB3D1 is never called again — because no user input occurs in MAME's automated test run. With an empty buffer, the dispatcher has nothing to process, so `LABEL_F98697` is never invoked again.

**Critically, the logic would work correctly with user input:** Table entry[1] (at ROM `0xE014D0`, used when `8D38=0x01`) contains a 16-bit array with `0x7002` at index [79] (ROM address `0xE0156E`). The comparison key is `(C080 << 8) | C07D = (0x70 << 8) | 0x02 = 0x7002`. So if `LABEL_F98697` were called post-boot with chain `0x70` and param `0x02`, it WOULD find a match and send event `0x1C00038`.

**The real hardware** presumably triggers FDB3D1 via user button presses or directional encoder navigation, which posts events to the `0xBD3C` buffer. In MAME's automated Feature Demo test mode, no such input is simulated. The Feature Demo would work on real hardware if a user navigated to it with actual button input.

### Previously investigated (and ruled out) blocking points

| Issue | Ruling |
|-------|--------|
| Audio initialization delay | `Audio_WaitForReady` has a 61,440-iteration timeout — exits gracefully even if SubCPU doesn't respond; not a hard block |
| VRAM display mode | VRAM writes do occur; display mode itself is not the primary blocker |
| XML parser state | SSF parser never starts because `0x1C00006` is never sent |
| `DemoMode_Main_Operation` loop | Expected behaviour (`jp Seq_StartMainControl`); not a hang |

### MAME floppy disk type bug (separate issue)

The MAME driver previously registered only a `"35dd"` (720 KB double-density) floppy connector in `kn5000_floppies`. The real hardware uses **1.44 MB HD (high-density)** drives — confirmed by:
- FDC format configuration supporting 1440K (18 sectors/track, 80 tracks)
- `update_disc.img` analysis: FAT12, OEM-ID `"Technics"`, 2880 sectors, 18 sectors/track, 2 heads

This has been fixed in the MAME driver. It is a separate issue from the Feature Demo image display failure.

### How event 0x1C00038 is generated — detailed analysis

#### `LABEL_F98697` — the event sender

The function `LABEL_F98697` (ROM `0xF98697`) is the code that sends event `0x1C00038`. It is **not called directly** — instead, it appears as a function-pointer entry in many UI widget handler chains (in the ROM pointer tables at `LABEL_EE7FA8`, `LABEL_EE7FD4`, `LABEL_EE7FFC`, etc.). When any widget using one of these handler chains processes certain events (typically user interaction events), it walks its handler chain and calls `LABEL_F98697`.

`LABEL_F98697` logic:

1. Calls `0xEF0797` to check bit 7 of DRAM `0x0406`. This flag is SET once during boot by `Boot_DisplayScreen` (call at line 89160) and CLEARED only during flash memory updates. It should be set throughout normal operation, so this check passes.
2. Reads a byte from DRAM `0x8D38` (an array selector index `R`).
3. Reads a ROM pointer `P = ROM[0xE01F80 + R×4]`. The pointer `P` points to a ROM array of 16-bit state values ending in `0xFFFF`.
4. Walks the array at `P`, comparing each entry to the current selection state built from DRAM bytes `0xC07D` and `0xC080` (packed as `(0xC080 << 8) | 0xC07D`).
5. If a match is found (or if the first array entry is `0xFFFE`, indicating "always send"), builds a 32-bit XDE parameter from `0xC07D`–`0xC080` and sends event `0x1C00038` to `XWA=0xFFFFFFFF` via `FA9945`.

#### `FA9945` — the broadcast event router

`FA9945` is the intermediate event-routing function called by `LABEL_F98697`. It checks a dynamic routing table in DRAM at `0x02BC34` (populated at runtime by `FA9752`). For each registered entry, it checks whether the entry's event code matches `0x1C00038` **and** whether the entry's "match value" equals the upper 16 bits of the XDE parameter. If a match is found, the event is forwarded to the registered handler (GroupBoxProc instance).

#### `FA9752` — the event queue writer (`PostEvent`)

`FA9752` (labeled `PostEvent` in the disassembly) **inserts events into a circular event queue** at DRAM `0x02BC34` (head/tail pointers at `0x02EC34`/`0x02EC36`). Each 12-byte queue entry holds:

```
entry[0..3]  = self pointer (XWA) — object ID posting the event
entry[4..7]  = event code (XBC)
entry[8..11] = param (XDE)
```

`FA9945` is the queue **processor/router**: it reads pending entries from `0x02BC34`, and for each entry with event code `0x1C00038`, checks whether the upper 16 bits of the parameter match a value stored in the entry. If the queue is empty, it posts the new event directly via `FA9D58`.

The event routing for `0x1C00038` therefore works through the standard event queue. `LABEL_F98697` acts as the PRODUCER: it checks state bytes, then pushes `0x1C00038` + packed XDE into the queue via `FA9945`. The CONSUMER is whichever widget handler receives the queued event — presumably GroupBoxProc, once it has received its own event setup during initialization.

For GroupBoxProc to receive the queued `0x1C00038`, it must either:
- Be the current "active" widget receiving events from the queue, OR
- Have registered via some dispatch mechanism that routes `0x1C00038` to it specifically

### Lua trace investigation findings (March 2026)

Investigation used MAME Lua autoboot scripts to monitor `LABEL_F98697`, `FA9945`, and `GroupBoxProc_StartSSFPresentation` during MAME runs. Key findings:

**MAME Lua API constraints discovered:**
- `install_read_tap` requires **word-aligned ranges** (even→odd address pair, e.g., `0xF98696-0xF98697`)
- Notifier handles from `add_machine_frame_notifier` / `add_machine_stop_notifier` must be **saved to outer-scope variables** to prevent garbage collection — otherwise callbacks silently stop
- **Critical conflict:** `emu.add_machine_frame_notifier` + `install_read_tap` are mutually exclusive — when both are active, read taps stop firing entirely

**Early trace results (pre-solution):**
| Monitor | Count | Observations |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `LABEL_F98697` tap (0xF98696-0xF98697) | 900+ calls | All during boot init; all with `8D38=0x00` (empty table); C080 sweeps `0x00→0x9A`, C07D cycles `0x01..0x17` |
| `FA9945` for XBC=0x1C00038 | 0 calls | Never fired — F98697 always returned early |
| `GroupBoxProc_StartSSFPresentation` | 0 real calls | One false positive (tap at F9A272 fires from 3rd word fetch of `call 0xfa9660` instruction at F9A26F) |
| DRAM `0x8D38` at ~12s, ~25s, ~37s | 0x00, 0xEF, 0x01 | Transitions from boot init → stable post-boot |

**False positive explained:** The "SSF START" tap at `0xF9A272-0xF9A273` fires from the instruction `call 0xfa9660` at `0xF9A26F` (a 4-byte instruction encoding `1D 60 96 FA`). Its 3rd word occupies `0xF9A272-0xF9A273`, triggering the tap on every call to `0xFA9660` (the direct SendEvent dispatcher), not from `GroupBoxProc_StartSSFPresentation` actually executing.

**Confirmed solution results (ftdemo_v3.lua):**
| Monitor | Count | Observations |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `LABEL_F98697` | 994 calls | Called but EF0797 pre-condition blocked all (internal RAM 0x0406 bit 7 not set in emulation context) |
| `FA9945` for 0x1C00038 | 0 calls | Not used — DEMO button in state 0xE4 goes direct to GroupBoxProc via soft-button path |
| `GroupBoxProc_StartSSFPresentation` tap | 9 hits | Each hit = `call 0xfa9660` at 0xF9A26F dispatching one SSF item (0x1C0001C with B80A workspace) |
| FTBMP01.BMP in VRAM | Confirmed | "Technics" logo text visible in emulator snapshots 0124-0126 |
| Final `8D38` state | 0x01 | Returned to normal after SSF completed |

**Conclusion:** No MAME emulation bug. The Feature Demo works correctly when the correct navigation sequence is used. The DEMO button in the FEATURE PRESENTATION sub-menu (state 0xE4) triggers SSF directly through GroupBoxProc's own event handler — not via the F98697/FA9945 dispatch chain. F98697 is a post-boot state-dispatch router that handles events from the hardware key scanner, while GroupBoxProc handles soft-button events directly from the INTA system.

## SSF Presentation Gate Table (`SSF_PresentationGateTable`, 0xE01F80)

The firmware uses a 256-entry ROM lookup table at **0xE01F80** to control which UI states allow the Feature Demo to be triggered. This table is the gating mechanism that determines whether pressing a panel button sends event `0x1C00038` — the event that ultimately starts the SSF presentation.

### Structure

The table occupies 1024 bytes (0xE01F80–0xE02380) and consists of 256 `.long` (32-bit little-endian) pointer entries. Each pointer points to a **state-value array** — a list of 16-bit values terminated by `0xFFFF` — stored elsewhere in the ROM (0xE014CE–0xE01F7E).

```
SSF_PresentationGateTable:
    .long LABEL_E014CE    ; entry[0x00] — boot/init state
    .long LABEL_E014D0    ; entry[0x01] — normal operation
    .long LABEL_E0157E    ; entry[0x02]
    ...                   ; (256 entries total)
    .long LABEL_E01F7E    ; entry[0xFF]
```

### How It Works

1. **Index selection:** The current UI mode is stored as a byte at DRAM address `0x8D38`. The getter function at `0xF0618F` loads this value. Common values include:
   - `0x00` — boot/initialization
   - `0x01` — normal operation
   - `0xE0` — DEMONSTRATION menu
   - `0xE4` — FEATURE PRESENTATION sub-menu

2. **Table lookup:** `GroupBoxNotify_SendSSFEvent` (0xF98697) reads the byte `R` from `0x8D38` and loads the pointer `P = SSF_PresentationGateTable[R]`.

3. **State matching:** The 16-bit array at `P` is checked against the current panel selection state (packed from DRAM bytes `0xC07D` and `0xC080` as `(C080 << 8) | C07D`):
   - `{0xFFFE}` — **always match**: the event fires unconditionally
   - `{0xFFFF}` — **never match**: the entry is disabled, no event sent
   - `{val1, val2, ..., 0xFFFF}` — **conditional**: each value is compared to the packed state; if any matches, the event fires

4. **Event dispatch:** When a match is found, `GroupBoxNotify_SendSSFEvent` sends event `0x1C00038` via the broadcast router at `0xFA9945`, which forwards it to registered widgets (typically `GroupBoxProc`).

### Role in Feature Demo Activation

The gate table ensures the Feature Demo can only be activated from specific UI states. During boot (`0x8D38 = 0x00`), `entry[0]` points to `{0xFFFF}` — immediately terminating, blocking any SSF events. After boot stabilizes and the user navigates to the DEMONSTRATION menu, `0x8D38` transitions to values whose table entries contain valid state arrays.

However, as documented in the MAME investigation above, the actual Feature Demo activation in practice bypasses this table entirely: pressing DEMO in the FEATURE PRESENTATION sub-menu (state `0xE4`) triggers `GroupBoxProc_StartSSFPresentation` directly through the soft-button event path, not through `GroupBoxNotify_SendSSFEvent`.

The gate table's primary role appears to be **gating hardware button events** — when the event buffer dispatcher (`0xFDB328`) processes button presses from the key scanner, it invokes `GroupBoxNotify_SendSSFEvent` as part of widget handler chains. The table then determines whether those hardware button events should propagate as SSF trigger events based on the current UI mode.

### State-Value Arrays

Each gate table entry points to a **state-value array** — a sequence of 16-bit little-endian values terminated by `0xFFFF`. Each value encodes `(chain_index << 8) | param`, matching the packed panel selection state from DRAM bytes `0xC080` (chain index) and `0xC07D` (param).

Known arrays in ROM range 0xE014CE–0xE01F7E:

| Label | Address | Entries | Content | Used by mode |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|--------------|
| `LABEL_E014CE` | 0xE014CE | 0 | `{0xFFFF}` — disabled | 0x00 (boot/init) |
| `LABEL_E014D0` | 0xE014D0 | ~215 | Chains 0x00–0x0C, 0x91 — many states | 0x01 (normal) |
| `LABEL_E0157E` | 0xE0157E | 0 | `{0xFFFF}` — disabled | 0x02 |
| `LABEL_E01580` | 0xE01580 | ~215 | Chains 0x00–0x0C, 0x43, 0x48, 0x70, 0x80, 0x91, 0x98 | 0x03 |
| `LABEL_E0174A` | 0xE0174A | 1 | Chain 0x91, param 0x00 | 0x04 |
| **`SSF_GateStates_Mode05`** | 0xE0174E | 14 | Chain 0x92, params 0x00–0x0D | **0x05** |
| `LABEL_E0176C` | 0xE0176C | — | Binary data (incbin) | 0x06+ |

The `SSF_GateStates_Mode05` array (0xE0174E) is a representative example: when the UI is in mode 5 (`0x8D38 = 0x05`), the SSF event fires only if the current panel state has chain index `0x92` and a param value between `0x00` and `0x0D`. All other panel states are blocked.

## Interpretation

The XML presentation system — with its `EXEC` tag, `SONG` playback, `IMG` display, rich tag vocabulary, and event-driven architecture — was almost certainly designed to be more flexible than its single current usage (a hardcoded Feature Demo in ROM).

The most likely explanation: **Technics designed a general-purpose presentation engine**, perhaps intended for:

- **Dealer demonstration discs** — scripted presentations showcasing the keyboard's features at retail stores
- **Educational materials** — step-by-step tutorials loaded from floppy
- **Trade show content** — automated demonstrations for NAMM or music trade events

The infrastructure was built (XML parser, event system, tag vocabulary, `EXEC` command support), but the floppy loading path was either never completed or was removed before release. What shipped was a single ROM-resident Feature Demo using a fraction of the system's capabilities.

The user's memory of "feature presentation discs" may refer to this planned-but-unshipped feature, or to the commercially-sold style/song demo discs that showcased the keyboard's capabilities using standard MIDI file playback.

## Demo Timer State Machine

The Feature Demo uses a timer-driven state machine to sequence through demo items. The timer variable is at DRAM address 3375 (0xD2F).

### Timer-Driven Entry Point

`Demo_SelectEntry_TimerTick` (0xF86D45) is called from the main loop timer. Each tick:

1. Checks control panel state (`Demo_SelectEntry_CheckCPanel`)
2. Decrements the countdown at address 3375
3. At count=10 (`0x0A`): loads the next song pattern and starts playback
4. At count=3: calls `Demo_SelectEntry_StartPlayback` to begin accompaniment
5. At count=1: updates display state

### Song Processing Flow

`Demo_SelectEntry_ProcessSongList` (0xF86D86) manages song selection:

1. Checks if song list at address 10420 is empty — if so, goes to countdown
2. Checks bit 3 of address 10413 for auto-play vs manual mode
3. In auto-play: compares current song index (10404) with target (4439)
4. Calls `Demo_WaitForDisplayBit` — busy-wait loop checking bit 2 of address 1056 (display ready flag) with 0xFFFFFF timeout
5. Calls `Banner_Loop_Check` — sends note-off commands (status 0xD3) to all 16 channels, cleaning up active notes
6. Increments song index at address 4440 and loops

### Display Wait

`Demo_WaitForDisplayBit` (0xF86F2C) is a timeout-protected busy-wait:

```
Loop 0xFFFFFF times:
    If bit 2 of DRAM[0x420] == 0: return (display ready)
Return after timeout
```

This ensures display operations complete before the next slide loads. The timeout prevents a hard hang if the display never becomes ready.

### Demo Timer Behavior in MAME

When the timer reaches 10, `Demo_SelectEntry_PlaySong` is called. This function calls `SwbtWr_ReinitBothBanks`, which runs the SwbtWr dispatch loop inline — processing 450+ buffered tone generator events. Each callback takes ~35ms, causing a **~16 second blocking period** where the main loop is paused.

After SwbtWr processing completes (~960 frames), PlaySong returns (sets `DRAM[0x8F4E]` from `0x04` to `0x06`), and the timer resumes counting down from 10. The tone generator hold timer (2 seconds per voice) then controls the pacing of subsequent song transitions.

**Note:** The 16-second initial delay may differ from real hardware where DSP writes are faster (direct hardware registers vs. HLE emulation). See [research log]({{ site.baseurl }}/feature-demo-investigation-2026-03-09/) for detailed investigation.

### Key DRAM Addresses

| 10404 (0x28A4) | Active demo entry index |
| 10413 (0x28AD) | Demo control flags (bit 3 = auto-play) |
| 10420 (0x28B4) | Song list pointer |
| 36148 (0x8D34) | UI state byte |
| 36152 (0x8D38) | UI sub-state byte (0xE4 = Feature Presentation) |
| 36686 (0x8F4E) | Playback state flag |
