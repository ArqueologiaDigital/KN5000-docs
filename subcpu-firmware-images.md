# Sub-CPU Firmware Images (v1.40 / v1.41 / v1.42)

The KN5000's sub-CPU has a 128 KB boot ROM of its own (`kn5000_subcpu_boot.ic30`, mapped at
`0xFE0000`) but no flash holding its 192 KB *runtime* payload: that payload is pushed across
the inter-CPU link at every boot by `SubCPU_Send_Payload` (see
[SubCPU Payload Loading]({{ site.baseurl }}/subcpu-payload-loading/)).

**Where the main CPU is *supposed* to read it from is now settled; where our dumps put it
is not.** The routine takes one of two source bases: the SLIDE4K image at Custom Data flash
`0x3E0000`, or — only when that fails its magic check — table-data `0x800000`. The first is
the live path on every firmware version we hold, and a File Type 007 update disc is proven
to write the compressed payload there verbatim. But in our IC19 dump that region is 131,072
bytes of `0xFF` with no `SLIDE` magic anywhere in the image, and the table-data fallback at
`0x800100` is `0xF7` filler behind a pointer table. A machine matching our dumps could not
start its sub-CPU. That is a **dump-provenance** problem, not a firmware one; the full
evidence and the measurements that would settle it are on
[Sub-CPU Payload Provenance]({{ site.baseurl }}/subcpu-payload-provenance/).

Three revisions of that payload survive, and they survive in two different shapes — which
turns out to matter for preservation.

## The two shapes

**Decompressed payload (196,608 bytes).** What the sub-CPU actually executes. This is the
form the disassembly reconstructs and the form `compare_roms.py` checks.

**Firmware-update image (~93 KB).** What ships on a system-update floppy: an 11-byte
header — `"SLIDE4K"` + NUL, then the decompressed size as a 24-bit **big-endian** value
(`03 00 00` = 196,608) — followed by the LZSS stream. The update handler for File Type 007
("Technics KN5000 Program DATA FILE PCK") writes it into Custom Data flash at `0x3E0000`
**verbatim**, exactly `0x20000` bytes, after erasing the two sectors there. It is not a
transient staging area: the main CPU decompresses it afresh on **every** boot.

The `SubCPU_Send_Payload` fallback branch points at table-data `0x800000` (not `0x830000`,
which is the start of the five *unconditional* tone-database transfers that run whichever
source is chosen). `0x800100` onward is preset-bank filler, so the fallback would ship
garbage. See [LZSS Compression]({{ site.baseurl }}/lzss-compression/).

All three compressed images in the repository were extracted from the
[system update floppy disk images](https://archive.org/details/technics-kn5000-system-update-disks)
on the Internet Archive.

## Dump provenance

### The compressed images are carved artifacts, not tool output

`kn5000_subprogram_v142_compressed.rom` is byte-identical to bytes `[0x0F03A9, +93203)` of
`kn5000_v10_disk.img` (sha1 `a892bedc…`) — it was cut out of that floppy. Recompressing the
payload with this project's own encoder produces 93,171 bytes, a different length, so the
file cannot be a tool output. Decoding the two SLIDE4K streams that disc carries reproduces
`kn5000_v10_program.rom` (2,097,152 B) and `kn5000_subprogram_v142.rom` (196,608 B) exactly,
which makes the **v10 ↔ v1.42 pairing a measured fact**.

The v1.41 → v7/v8 and v1.40 → v5/v6 pairings that MAME's BIOS options assert are **not**
measured — only the v10 update disc is available to this project. They rest on filename
inference and should be treated as such until a v5–v9 disc turns up.

### The boot ROM `kn5000_subcpu_boot.ic30` is only 11% dumped

**Owner testimony (Felipe, 2026-08-08).** IC30 was dumped **partially and deliberately**.
The tooling could copy only small chunks at a time, so he read the regions that appeared to
hold the boot code needed to make the emulator work, analysed that code, and — as far as he
could assess at the time — found no references into the regions he had not read. He
concluded the rest was very likely `0xFF`. **He calls this an educated guess, not a
measurement**, and intends a full dump when he regains physical access to the instrument
(it is in storage in another country).

Measured: 14,336 bytes were read (10.9% of the chip); **116,736 bytes, 89.1%, are `0xFF` by
assumption**; and only **4,352 bytes of the whole 128 KB chip — 3.3% — are real data**, in
three blocks at CPU `0xFF8000-0xFF904C`, `0xFFFE80-0xFFFFB3` and `0xFFFFF0-0xFFFFFF`.

The guess holds up well under test: a structure-aware census over the byte-identical
disassembly found 220 ROM-address references, all in dumped windows and none in an undumped
range, and the loaded v1.42 payload calls back into IC30 at only two addresses, both dumped.
The one counter-example (`ROM_CHECKSUM` reading 2 KB past the dumped window) is
content-independent and does not run in a normal boot. See
[ROM Reconstruction]({{ site.baseurl }}/rom-reconstruction/#dump-provenance) for the full
figures, and note that a full IC30 dump would *not* answer the payload-source question —
the payload is larger than the entire chip and IC30 is not in the main CPU's address space.

MAME flags the file `BAD_DUMP` and states the assumption inline. That flag should stay until
the chip is read in full.

## Status of each revision

| Revision | Update image | Decompressed payload | Source tree | In `make all` |
|----------|-------------:|---------------------:|-------------|---------------|
| v1.40 | 93,124 B | 196,608 B — **recovered, committed** | no | no |
| v1.41 | 93,181 B | 196,608 B | no — tracked as `kn5000-v41` | no |
| v1.42 | 93,203 B | 196,608 B | `v142/subcpu/` | **yes, both shapes** |

### v1.42 — fully covered

The v1.42 payload is source-built and byte-identical. Since August 2026 its *update image*
is a verification target too: the build recompresses the source-built payload with
`compress_lzss.py --strict --with-header --reference` — replaying the factory encoder's
own match/literal decisions — and `cmp`s the result against
`original_ROMs/kn5000_subprogram_v142_compressed.rom`. It appears in `compare_roms.py` as
the *subcpu v142 update image* section, at 100.00%.

sha256 of the payload: `16a1b654cea132ac433c16162db4a72ef7227fcc962ff6fae0ce088aa7c6e76e`.

### v1.40 — a preservation recovery

**Before August 2026, no decompressed copy of the v1.40 sub-CPU payload existed anywhere
in this project.** The only artifact was the compressed update image, and nothing in the
build ever unpacked it. A corrupted or lost 93 KB file would have taken the revision with
it.

The 196,608-byte payload has now been decompressed out of that single copy and committed
as `original_ROMs/kn5000_subprogram_v140.rom` (commit `2fb8a95`):

```
sha256  a39025fe7c3968102196c5e20c18c76ec42e31a6c535f48addd58e13dacd7ef0
size    196,608 bytes
```

The recovery is self-checking in both directions: recompressing the extracted payload with
`compress_lzss.py --strict --with-header --reference` against the factory image reproduces
that image **byte for byte** (93,124/93,124). The extraction is therefore not an
interpretation — it is the exact preimage of the shipped file.

There is still no v1.40 source tree, and the payload is not part of any build target. What
exists is an honest, hash-pinned artifact plus a reversible path back to the original.

### v1.41 — internally consistent, no source tree

Both v1.41 artifacts verify against each other: the compressed image decompresses
byte-exactly to `original_ROMs/kn5000_subprogram_v141.rom` (196,608/196,608, consuming
93,181/93,181 input bytes), and recompressing that payload reproduces the image
byte-for-byte. What is missing is a `v141/subcpu/` source tree, so `compare_roms.py`
cannot cover either artifact.

sha256 of the payload: `04212fa6799e75db64b399242b762ce7377669a0a877984659c78c148453d9fe`.

This is tracked as issue **`kn5000-v41`** in the disassembly repository. The proposed route
is the one the main-CPU v7/v9/v10 trees already use: start from the v142 source and
reconcile against the v141 ROM. The raw byte diff looks daunting but is not — most of it is
address-constant ripple that symbolic assembly absorbs for free:

| Pair | Differing bytes | Contiguous runs |
|------|----------------:|----------------:|
| v1.40 ↔ v1.41 | 56,018 | 2,508 |
| v1.41 ↔ v1.42 | 124,033 | 2,875 |
| v1.40 ↔ v1.42 | 124,032 | 2,590 |

v1.40 is much closer to v1.41 than to v1.42, so a future v1.40 tree should be diffed
against v1.41 rather than against the current target.

## Why the update-image target matters

Verifying only the decompressed payload leaves a gap: the bytes a real KN5000 receives from
a firmware-update disk are the *compressed* ones. Adding the compress-and-compare rule
closes it, and it does so without weakening anything — `--strict` aborts the build the
moment the encoder's output diverges from the factory stream, so the check cannot degrade
into "close enough". The same guarantee already covers the in-ROM SLIDE4K demo presets and
the SLIDE8K help databases; see
[ROM Reconstruction]({{ site.baseurl }}/rom-reconstruction/).
