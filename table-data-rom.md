# Table Data ROM Structure

The Table Data ROM is a 2 MB flash pair mapped at **0x800000-0x9FFFFF** after boot-time
memory reconfiguration. At power-on the CPU sees it at 0xE00000-0xFFFFFF (overlapping the
Program ROM), and the first-stage bootloader at the end of this ROM performs the hardware
setup before the remap. It holds the factory preset banks, the tone database, the on-screen
fonts and artwork, the Music Stylist and HELP databases, the demo songs, and the
first-stage bootloader itself.

**Conversion status.** As of the 2026-08-07 conversion waves this ROM is *fully accounted
for*: every byte is either symbolic assembly source or an explicitly labelled, named
binary slice, and the reconstruction is byte-exact against the dump (the disassembly
repo's build gate requires a 100 % byte-match after every merge). "Accounted for" is not
the same as "fully understood" — several regions below are correctly located and named but
their internal field semantics are still undecoded. Those are called out per section and
summarised under [What is still open](#what-is-still-open).

## Source modules

The top-level module is `table_data/kn5000_table_data.s` in the
[disassembly repo](https://github.com/ArqueologiaDigital/kn5000-roms-disasm); its banner is the
canonical table of contents. Large regions live in their own modules:

## Section directory and preset banks (0x800000)

The ROM opens with a 34-entry table of 4-byte little-endian pointers — 33 section pointers
plus a null terminator. A section's size is the distance to the next-higher directory
target, and the targets are **not** in address order: entry 7 points backwards into this
half (`0x82CDA2`), and entries 6 and 28-32 point *forward* into the UI-bitmap half of the
ROM at `0x91D000` and above.

This 192 KB half is the rewritable user-data area of the table-data flash pair. A
"`Technics KN5000 Table    DATA FILE 1/2`" update floppy rewrites the whole half through
`HANDLE_UPDATE_FILE_TYPE_ID_003h` -> `Flash_BurnWithProgress` + `FDC_WriteSectors`. No
disassembled Main-CPU or Sub-CPU code reads an individual directory entry or section
address directly, so the per-section roles are described **structurally** in the source:
the factory images here are the power-on/factory-reset defaults for the user's
sound/registration/Composer memories, but the exact mapping of section number to feature
is still unattributed.

Factory fill patterns encode the initialization state of each bank: `0xF7`/`0xF8` erased
flash, `0x07`/`0x06` default parameter values, `0x00` zeroed fields, `0xFF`/`0xFE`/`0xFC`
empty fields.

Dominant record grids (all exact size divisors, from autocorrelation):

| Sections | Grid |
|:---|:---|
| 0, 1 | 95 x 120 B |
| 3-5 | 222 x 22 B |
| 8 | 25 x 112 B |
| 9 | 18 x 80 B |
| 10 | 25 x 114 B |
| 11 | 20 x 108 B |
| 12-24 | 52 x 58 B (13 uniform 3,016-byte slots) |
| 25-27 | 108 x 296 B (3 uniform 31,968-byte slots) |

Section 7 is the outlier: its directory target is `0x82CDA2`, and its in-half extent runs
from there to the end of the half at `0x82FFFF` — 12,894 bytes. Those bytes are
bitmap-like: roughly 200-byte-period rows of palette indices `0x22-0x2E` over the `0xF7`
background `DrawBitmap` treats as transparent. The section's actual save/load span is
**unverified**.

> **Caveat on the size heuristic.** `preset_banks.s` derives each section's size as the
> distance to the next-higher directory target, which reports **983,646 bytes** for
> section 7 — the gap from `0x82CDA2` to entry 6's target at `0x91D000`, on the far side
> of the ROM. That figure nominally swallows the tone database, the feature demo and both
> wallpapers, none of which belong to section 7. It is an artifact of the heuristic, not a
> section length. The same artifact is present in the source module's own comment.

## Tone database (0x830000-0x87FFEF)

The upper 320 KB of the first megabyte is the **tone database** — the sound-parameter data
the Main CPU ships wholesale to the Sub CPU at boot. `SubCPU_Send_Payload` issues five
64 KB InterCPU E1 bulk transfers copying ROM `0x830000-0x87FFFF` to Sub-CPU work RAM
`0x050000-0x09FFFF`, so every offset inside the database is equally readable as a Sub-CPU
address. It contains the 629-entry tone-record offset table at `0x831B00`, 579
variable-length tone/voice records, drum kits, percussion instruments, drawbar presets,
name lists and envelope data.

See **[Tone Database]({{ site.baseurl }}/tone-database/)** for the full structure. It is
*not* duplicated here.

> **Superseded:** earlier revisions of this page described an "Instrument Patch Data"
> region at 0x832000-0x850000 with ~303 patches, derived from a string scan. The real
> structure is the tone database above; the record grid and record count come from the
> offset table, not from string spacing.

## Feature-demo assets (0x87FFF0-0x8CE0C9)

`FeatureDemo_FileMetadata` at `0x87FFF0` is a small file record for `hkst_55.ssf`, pointing
at the SSF slideshow script that follows. The filename does double duty as a **version
stamp**: `Boot_ParseSubCPUTimestamp` points `ParseInt16` at `0x87FFF5` — the "55" inside
`hkst_55.ssf` — so the digits in this filename are the table-data revision number the boot
code parses.

The script itself (`Feature_Demo_XML`) is one unbroken ASCII run in the SSF `ACTION`
format: 27 sequential `<ACT>` steps, each showing one display object. Most steps name a
slide image (`ftdemo01`, `ftdemo04`, ...); steps 16/17, 19/20 and 25 bring up the live
`Accordion`, `Drawbar` and `Sdmixer` UI widget pages between slides. See
[SSF Presentation System]({{ site.baseurl }}/ssf-presentation/) and
[Feature Demo]({{ site.baseurl }}/feature-demo/).

The six slide images are ordinary Windows 3.x BMP files (8bpp indexed, 256-colour palette,
320 px wide) stored verbatim, each echoed by a 24-byte `FeatureDemo_FileEntry` record at
`0x8CE01C` giving name, address and size:

| Label | Address | File | Size |
|:---|:---|:---|---:|
| `Feature_Bitmap_1` | `0x880418` | `FTBMP01.BMP` | 77,878 B |
| `Feature_Bitmap_2` | `0x89344E` | `FTBMP02.BMP` | 42,678 B |
| `Feature_Bitmap_3` | `0x89DB04` | `FTBMP03.BMP` | 39,478 B |
| `Feature_Bitmap_4` | `0x8A753A` | `FTBMP04.BMP` | 39,478 B |
| `Feature_Bitmap_5` | `0x8B0F70` | `FTBMP05.BMP` | 41,078 B |
| `Feature_Bitmap_6` | `0x8BAFE6` | `FTBMP06.BMP` | 77,878 B |

## Demo-song presets (SLIDE4K)

Nineteen compressed preset blocks hold the panel setups for the demo songs. Eighteen of
them (entries 0-17) sit at `0x9C4050-0x9F94CA`, abutting one another except for a single
`0xFF` pad byte at `0x9C9017`, with `0xFF` fill from `0x9F94CB` to the end of the region;
**entry 18, the Feature Demo preset, is stored apart at `0x8E0000`** and decompresses to
38,144 bytes.

`DemoSongPreset_PointerTable` at `0x9C4000` is the index: 19 four-byte LE pointers plus a
null terminator, read by the `Demo_GetPresetBaseForPart` family as
`sla wa, 2; add xwa, 0x9C4000; ld xwa, (xwa)`. A non-null entry means the SLIDE4K block it
points at is decompressed to RAM `0x69800`; a null entry for index 0-18 falls back to the
live preset area at `0x0AB000`.

Each block is an 11-byte header — 8-byte `"SLIDE4K\0"` magic plus a **24-bit big-endian**
decompressed size — followed by the LZSS stream. All 19 blocks are build products, and the
checked-in sources are **not** binaries: each preset ships as a MIDI file plus a YAML
sidecar (`table_data/includes/demo_presets/midi/demo_preset_NN.mid` +
`sidecar/demo_preset_NN.yaml`). `midi_to_preset.py` regenerates the decompressed preset and
`compress_lzss.py --strict --reference` recompresses it byte-identically; both `.bin` stages
are generated and git-ignored. Two errata worth recording from that verification:

* the size field is 24-bit **big**-endian, not little-endian as older notes stated;
* preset 17's LZSS stream ends at `0x9F5676`; the remaining ~15.9 KB of its slice is
  non-stream tail carried verbatim.

See [LZSS Compression]({{ site.baseurl }}/lzss-compression/) for the codec.

Entries 0-17 also survive verbatim, header and payload, in the dead tail of
`table_data/includes/icons_to_strings.bin` — a pre-conversion duplicate that no build
reads. See *The backing blob* below before treating it as a second copy of anything.

> **Superseded:** earlier revisions of this page called `0x9C4000` a "Waveform Sample
> Table" pointing at PCM samples. It is the demo-song preset pointer table; the KN5000's
> PCM waveforms live in the dedicated wave ROMs, not here.

## Wallpapers (0x8ED000, 0x900000)

Two 320x240 8bpp LCD background images, 76,800 bytes each, referenced by `SetWallPaper`
via the wallpaper table at `0xEAAE62` in the Main CPU ROM:

* **Wallpaper 0** (`0x8ED000`) — blue textured pattern
* **Wallpaper 1** (`0x900000`) — Technics-branded texture

Each is followed by a 1 KB trailer. In both trailers the `+0x380` slot holds a 16-entry
ramp of ascending `{r, g, b, 0x00}` quadruplets (`Wallpaper0_ShadeRamp`, and the matching
`WallpaperRamp_*` set in `ui_bitmaps.s`); Wallpaper_1's trailer additionally carries a bank
of four candidate ramps at `+0x80`. **No code reference to these ramps has been found yet**,
so the RGB reading is tentative — the values behave like one (monotonically brightening
triplets), but nothing has been traced that consumes them.

## UI bitmaps, frames and icons (0x912C00-0x944D77)

This region was formerly one opaque blob whose filename claimed it was a gap. It is three
distinct drawing resources plus six factory images.

**`BitmapDescriptorTable` (`0x913000`)** — 34 entries of `{u16 width, u16 height, u32 ptr}`
plus a null terminator, indexed by the bitmap number passed to `DrawBitmap` /
`DrawBitmapFast` (`index * 8` added to `0x913000`). The set is the UI's photographic-style
artwork: transport controls, the vertical fader, the 307x45 outlined "Technics" wordmark,
a "GENERAL MIDI SPECIAL" logo, LED buttons, and sixteen 32x32 sound-category icons (violin,
trumpet, drum kit, flutes, electric guitar, grand piano, drawbars, accordion, ...). Entry 0
is a 24x24 green worm wearing a straw hat — an easter egg, byte-identical to the Main CPU
ROM's own copy at `0xEA9F20`.

**`FrameDescriptorTable` (`0x934000`)** — 53 entries in the same format, indexed by
`DrawFrameSP`. This is a UI frame construction kit: rounded-rectangle corner pieces in
sizes 1/2/5/9/14 (TL, TR, BR, BL order), chevron arrowheads in five sizes each direction,
"ON/OFF" soft-button bodies with a pointed tab aimed at the physical buttons beside the
LCD, red arrows, 5x5 bevel-corner overlays in raised/outlined/sunken styles, and a wide
tab-bar body.

Pixel format for both tables: **8bpp indexed, two pixels per 16-bit word**, rows padded to
16-bit alignment (odd-width images carry one pad byte per row). Colour `0xF7` is
transparent. In frame pieces colour `0xF6` is a *template* colour replaced at draw time by
the caller's colour argument — which is how one master shape serves every button state.

**Factory image banks (`0x91D000-0x933FFF`)** — the six blocks that section-directory
entries 6 and 28-32 point at. They are floppy save/load banks whose factory content is a
set of full UI images, each byte-identical to a copy already in the Main CPU ROM:

| Bank | Image | Size | Main CPU copy |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 6 | Technics wordmark (black, transparent bg) | 312x45 | `0xE8FFA6` |
| 28 | The KN5000 itself on teal ("bmphk") | 100x120 | `0xE7BE12` |
| 29 | Vertical piano ruler, note-edit screen ("ntedt0k") | 16x127 | `0xE34E78` |
| 30 | Dotted note-edit grid ("ntedt0d") | 240x127 | `0xE35668` |
| 31 | Ruled instrument rows, drum-edit screen ("dredt0k") | 88x119 | `0xE3CD78` |
| 32 | Drum-edit grid ("dredt0d") | 168x119 | `0xE3F660` |

The original Matsushita asset names (`bmphk`, `ntedt0k`, `ntedt0d`, `dredt0k`, `dredt0d`)
survive in Main-CPU routine and widget names.

**Icons (`0x938000`)** — `IconTable` holds 176 entries of `{u16 bbox width, u16 bbox
height, u32 pixel pointer}` plus a terminator, indexed by the icon number passed to
`DrawIcons` (`0xFABF9B`). Every icon's pixel data is 24x24 at 4bpp (2 pixels per byte,
288 bytes, 12 bytes/row x 24 rows — `DrawIcons` hardcodes the geometry). The bounding-box
fields are UI hit-test dimensions only: icons 173-175 declare 27x27 or 28x28 but still
carry 24x24 pixels. A **177th icon** sits after the last referenced one — yellow "E.L.S."
lettering with small glyphs below, apparently a developer signature. No table entry points
at it, so it is unreachable art.

Icons use a 16-colour CGA/EGA-style palette; the lookup table at `0xEAABF2` in the Main CPU
ROM expands 4-bit nibbles to 8-bit palette indices into the main palette at `0xEB37DE`:

| Nibble | Palette index | Colour | Nibble | Palette index | Colour |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 0 | `0x00` | Black | 8 | `0xF8` | Dark Gray |
| 1 | `0x01` | Dark Red | 9 | `0xF9` | Bright Red |
| 2 | `0x02` | Dark Green | 10 | `0xFA` | Bright Green |
| 3 | `0x03` | Olive | 11 | `0xFB` | Yellow |
| 4 | `0x04` | Dark Blue | 12 | `0xFC` | Bright Blue |
| 5 | `0x05` | Dark Magenta | 13 | `0xFD` | Magenta |
| 6 | `0x06` | Dark Cyan | 14 | `0xFE` | Cyan |
| 7 | `0x07` | Light Gray (background) | 15 | `0xFF` | White |

Extracted renders of the icons and bitmaps are in the
[Image Gallery]({{ site.baseurl }}/image-gallery/).

## Fonts (0x944D78-0x950FFF)

`FontDescriptor_Table` at `0x945C00` holds ten 16-byte entries plus one all-zero unused
slot:

| Offset | Size | Field |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `+0x00` | word | Width in pixels (0 = proportional) |
| `+0x02` | word | Height in pixels |
| `+0x04` | word | Descender (pixels below baseline) |
| `+0x06` | word | Ascender (pixels above cap height) |
| `+0x08` | long | Pointer to the 1bpp glyph bank |
| `+0x0C` | long | Pointer to the kern table (0 = fixed width) |

Both consumers — `TextRender_LoadFontData` and `DrawString_Impl_ClipCursorYMin` in the Main
CPU ROM — compute `0x945C00 + 16 * font_id`. When the kern pointer is null they use `+0x00`
and `+0x06` for a fixed advance; otherwise the kern table drives per-character widths.

| Font | Geometry | Upper code page | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 0 | 8x16 fixed | UI symbols | Same letterforms as font 7 over 0x20-0x7E |
| 1 | 8x16 fixed | UI symbols | Glyphs sit 2 px higher in the cell than font 0 |
| 2 | 16x16 fixed | UI symbols | Double-width headline font |
| 3 | 6x8 fixed | UI symbols | Small font |
| 4 | 11x16 fixed | UI symbols | Same letterforms as font 9 over 0x20-0x7E |
| 5 | proportional, 16 px tall | Latin-1 accents | Only proportional font; widths 3-10 px |
| 6 | 8x10 fixed | UI symbols | Compact font |
| 7 | 8x16 fixed | Latin-1 accents | Font 0 letterforms |
| 8 | 8x16 fixed | Latin-1 accents | Font 1 letterforms |
| 9 | 11x16 fixed | Latin-1 accents | Font 4 letterforms |

Every bank covers characters 0x20-0xFF (224 glyphs — the renderer does `sub c, 0x20`).
A glyph is stored **column-major**: `ceil(width/8)` columns of `height` bytes each,
top-to-bottom, MSB = leftmost pixel of the 8-pixel column slice. The nine fixed banks tile
their address ranges exactly with no gaps. Font 5's kern table holds 224
`{u16 char_width, u16 glyph_offset}` pairs whose entries tile `0x94B7B0-0x94C61F` exactly.

The two upper-code-page flavours matter for the multilingual UI: fonts 0/1/2/3/4/6 use the
0x7F-0xFF range for arrows and markers with empty-box placeholders in the Latin-1 letter
slots, while fonts 5/7/8/9 carry real Latin-1 accented characters.

Font 9's bank runs past the `0x950000` boundary — characters 0xAD-0xFF live at
`0x950000-0x950A5F`. That area was previously misfiled as standalone "sparse bitmap-like
data"; it is simply the tail of font 9.

## Music Stylist database (0x951000-0x987FFF)

One thousand 198-byte records at `0x951000` hold the MUSIC STYLIST presets — 250 styles x 4
arrangement variations across ten categories — reached exclusively through two 1000-entry
pointer tables at `0x986000` and `0x987000`.

See **[Music Stylist Database]({{ site.baseurl }}/music-stylist-database/)** for the record layout,
category boundaries and the two table orderings.

> **Superseded:** earlier revisions of this page called `0x986000`/`0x987000`
> "model-specific preset tables" selected by a keyboard model code (0xC2 = KN3000,
> 0xC5 = KN5000). The selector byte at RAM `0x8D38` is the **current UI state ID**, not a
> model code: `EffectMode_ClampAndLookupPreset` picks the `0x986000` table for UI states
> 0xC2 and 0xC5 and the `0x987000` table for every other state.

## Help system (0x983B3A-0x9999D2)

Press HELP and then any panel button, and the firmware looks that button up in the active
language's database and renders the explanation.

The index at `0x988000` is **not** a demo-song table: it is the HELP language index, twelve
4-byte LE pointers forming two parallel 6-slot tables, both indexed by the help-language
number in RAM `0x0340E4`:

| Address | Table | Slot 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `0x988000` | `HelpIntro_LanguageTable` (intro strings) | EN `0x988030` | DE `0x988160` | FR `0x988296` | ES `0x988404` | EN again | ID `0x98855E` |
| `0x988018` | `HelpDB_LanguageTable` (SLIDE8K databases) | EN `0x988690` | DE `0x98BB3A` | FR `0x98F0DA` | ES `0x992A0C` | EN again | ID `0x9963FA` |

There are only five distinct languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Indonesian);
slot 4 of both tables reuses English. The intro strings at `0x988030-0x98868F` are the
null-terminated Latin-1 paragraphs shown on the HELP start screen (`~0d` is the newline
escape).

Each database is a **SLIDE8K** container — a previously undocumented 8 KB-window LZSS
variant that the firmware itself supports (`SLIDE_Parse_Header` dispatches on the `8` of
the magic to `SLIDE_Decompress_8K_Init`). The header is 11 bytes: `"SLIDE8K\0"` magic plus
a 24-bit big-endian decompressed size. The stream uses a 0x2000-byte ring pre-filled with
zeros and a write position starting at 0x1FF6, 13-bit absolute ring offsets and 3-10 byte
match lengths. Every block decompresses to exactly **0x9000 (36,864) bytes**: a
self-referential pointer table plus a help-string pool based at RAM `0x69800`.

Termination is purely by output count, so the final flag byte may be only partly consumed
and its unused bits are nonzero in these blocks; each stream is also odd-length and
followed by one alignment pad byte the decoder never reads. Only decision-replay against
the factory stream reproduces them byte-exactly, which is what the build does: the five
live payloads are **build products** recompressed from the decompressed sources in
`table_data/includes/help_databases/` by `compress_slide8k.py --strict --reference`, and
`make verify-help-databases` byte-compares all of them against the original slices.

A sixth, *stale* SLIDE8K block sits at `0x983B3A`: a superseded revision of the German
database, referenced by nothing in any program ROM (v7, v9 or v10). It is **truncated, not
merely corrupt** — the factory image wrote the two Music Stylist pointer tables at
`0x986000`/`0x987000` straight over its tail. Decoding it tracks the live German database
byte-for-byte for exactly 0x55E0 output bytes, and the element producing output 0x55E0 is
the first one to read past `0x985FFF`. Because its tail no longer exists it is preserved as
a raw, byte-exact slice of the dump rather than rebuilt from source.

Seven stray bytes follow the Indonesian database at `0x9999CC`: three `(0x7F, N)` pairs with
N stepping by 10 (`0xD8`, `0xE2`, `0xEC`) plus a lone `0x7E` — the tail of some stride-10
table from an earlier factory build. No pointer to that address exists in any ROM.

> **Superseded:** earlier revisions of this page claimed demo-song sequence data began at
> `0x9999CC` and that demo category names lived at `0x99EC00`. Neither is true:
> `0x9999CC` is the seven residue bytes above, `0x9999D3-0x99EBFF` is 0xFF fill, and
> `0x99EC00` is the Panel Memory bank-name table (below). The demo songs' *presets* are the
> SLIDE4K blocks indexed from `0x9C4000`.

## Panel Memory and Composer factory data (0x99EC00-0x9C3FFF)

`PanelMemory_BankNames` at `0x99EC00` is ten 16-character space-padded bank names — "Tour
Of The 5000", "Accordion", "Piano Styles", "Jazz&Rock Organ", "Church & Theatre", "Light
Orchestra", "Split Sounds", "Layer Production", "Special DSP FX", "World" — followed at
`0x99ECA0` by 80 factory preset records of 674 bytes each (10 banks x 8 PANEL MEMORY
buttons).

`Composer_FactoryMemoryImage` at `0x9B4000` is a 64 KB image of the COMPOSER (user rhythm
style) memory, copied wholesale to RAM `0x94800` at boot. It carries three factory user
styles in four variations each (" Pop Samba 1".."4", "GentleSwing 1".."4", "German 3/4
1".."4") plus 18 empty "Clear" slots, and from image offset `+0xAB00` (ROM `0x9BEB00`) the
rhythm cell streams in the same cell grammar the factory rhythms use — 52 `80 nn 00 FF FF 87`
cell headers, each on a 256-byte boundary. (The module header's "+0xC000" is too late by
0x1500 bytes.)

See **[Panel Memory & Composer Factory Data]({{ site.baseurl }}/panel-memory-factory-data/)** for the
record format and the loader routines.

## File identifier strings (0x9FA000)

Format identification strings used to detect floppy disk file types:

* `Technics KN5000 Program  DATA FILE 1/2`
* `Technics KN5000 Program  DATA FILE 2/2`
* `Technics KN5000 Program  DATA FILE PCK`
* `Technics KN5000 Table    DATA FILE 1/2`
* `Technics KN5000 Table    DATA FILE 2/2`
* `Technics KN5000 Table    DATA FILE PCK`
* `Technics KN5000 CMPCUSTOMDATA FILE`
* `Technics KN5000 HD-AEPRG DATA FILE`

## Boot screen bitmaps (0x9FA150)

A `"SLIDE"` marker string, then eight headerless 1bpp bitmaps (224x22, 616 bytes each)
shown during a firmware update: "Flash Memory Update", "Now Erasing", "FD to Flash Memory",
"Completed", "Please Wait", "Change FD 2 of 2", "Illegal Disk", "Turn On AGAIN". They are
byte-identical duplicates of the eight bitmaps in the Main CPU ROM at `0xE0018E-0xE0148D`
and are emitted from the same image files, so the duplication stays single-sourced. See
[Firmware Update Display]({{ site.baseurl }}/firmware-update-display/).

## FDC dispatch offset tables (0x9FB496)

Three `.short` offset tables driving the `JP T, XIX+WA` dispatches in the bootloader's FDC
driver. Because the bootloader runs with this ROM mapped at 0xE00000-0xFFFFFF, the
consuming code references them as `0xFFB4xx`.

| Table | Consumed at | Indexed by |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `FDC_DiskTypeStanza_Offsets` | `0xFFD98F` (`FDC_MediaConfigAndRecalibrate`) | Low nibble of the media-type code at `0x0C9C`, values 0-5 |
| `FDC_ValidateCmd_Offsets` | `0xFFDA97` (`FDC_ValidateRequest`) | Command word at `0x0C6E`, 0-11 |
| `FDC_CommandDispatch_Offsets` | `0xFFE9F4` (`FDC_Request`) | Command word, 0-11 |

The first two are byte-identical to copies the Main CPU's own FDC driver carries at
`0xEA98A6` and `0xEA98B2`. All targets are labelled in `boot_fdc_driver.s`, so the entries
are now symbolic label differences rather than raw constants. See
[FDC Subsystem]({{ site.baseurl }}/fdc-subsystem/).

## First-stage bootloader (0x9FB4E8-0x9FFFFF)

`Boot_Init` at `0x9FB4E8` (boot-time `0xFFB4E8`) runs at power-on while the CPU still sees
this ROM at 0xFFxxxx. It initializes the CPU and memory controller from code shared with
the Main CPU ROM, sets the stack pointer from `0x00987E`, clears RAM, copies
`Boot_BitMaskTable` and `Boot_InitParams` to RAM `0x1044`/`0x9998`, detects the region code
and boot mode, checks for a firmware-update floppy, validates flash integrity, reconfigures
CS2 to move this ROM to 0x800000, and hands control to the main Program ROM.

The bootloader is a complete little system of its own, disassembled in Wave 1 and Wave 2 of
the conversion effort. Beyond `Boot_Init` it contains a shared VGA register-init block
(`0x9FCDFC-0x9FD7E7`), an FDC command-layer driver with twelve commands
(`0x9FD8A5-0x9FEA9C`, previously mislabelled "flash update handlers"), a floppy
disk-format probe, a **boot-time control-panel serial driver that is entirely independent
of the runtime CP-serial stack**, three serial ISRs with a state-machine dispatch table, a
first-fit heap allocator with coalescing free plus a 32-bit divide/modulo runtime, and a
NOP-patched debug-output group that emits nothing in shipped firmware. `RESET_HANDLER` sits
at `0x9FFEE0` and the TMP94C241F interrupt vector table occupies the last 256 bytes.

See [Boot Sequence]({{ site.baseurl }}/boot-sequence/) for the system-level view and
[Control Panel Protocol]({{ site.baseurl }}/control-panel-protocol/) for the *runtime*
serial stack this boot driver must not be confused with.

## The backing blob (icons_to_strings.bin)

One artefact predates the whole conversion and still sits in the tree:
`table_data/includes/icons_to_strings.bin`, **742,024 bytes**, sha256
`0df126455434ccc35a9f40609ec26dc68edc2a170910de602a6fbe814f31379d`. It is a **verbatim
slice of the factory dump** — file offset 0 is ROM `0x944D78` and its last byte is ROM
`0x9F9FFF` — and as of commit `6ab2b5d` every one of those bytes is accounted for.

| Part | File offsets | ROM | Size | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|---:|:---|
| Read by the LLVM build | 13 sized `.incbin` slices | — | 126,674 B | live (17.1 % of the file) |
| Source-built here, still `binclude`d whole by the ASL mirror | remainder below `0x7F2D8` | `0x944D78-0x9C404F` | 394,246 B | live for the mirror only |
| Dead tail | `0x7F2D8-0xB5287` | `0x9C4050-0x9F9FFF` | 221,104 B | read by nothing |

The 13 live slices are the ten font glyph banks (`fonts.s`), the Music Stylist residue
block (`style_records.s`), the truncated stale German help block (`help_databases.s`) and
the 64 KB Composer factory memory image (`kn5000_table_data.s`). Every one lies inside the
extent the archived ASL mirror bincludes as a single block
(`binclude "includes/icons_to_strings.bin", 0, 07F2D8h`), which is why the file may not be
rewritten, re-sliced or truncated on disk even though the LLVM build now emits most of the
region from real source. The 80 bytes at file `0x7F288-0x7F2D7` (ROM `0x9C4000-0x9C404F`)
are the last thing the mirror still takes from the blob that this build emits from source:
`DemoSongPreset_PointerTable`'s 19 pointers plus its null terminator.

**The dead tail is a stale duplicate of the demo-song presets.** The 221,104 bytes past the
ASL extent are eighteen SLIDE4K blocks laid end to end — presets 0-17, one `0xFF`
alignment byte after preset 00 (ROM `0x9C9017`) and 2,869 bytes of `0xFF` fill after
preset 17's block ends at `0x9F94CA` — byte-identical to the reference payloads in
`original_ROMs/demo_preset_NN_compressed.original.bin`. Nothing reads them: not the LLVM
build, not the ASL mirror, not the bootstrap extraction (`make decompress-demo-presets`
reads `original_ROMs/kn5000_table_data.rom`, not this file). The ROM's live copy of those
bytes is rebuilt from `includes/demo_presets/midi/*.mid` plus its YAML sidecars.

The tail was **documented rather than removed**. Deleting it would save 221 KB and break
neither build, but it would rewrite a checked-in dump artefact whose hash is quoted in
`analysis/binclude-audit-2026-08-07/`; and re-slicing the region would give the
demo-preset bytes a *second* source, which is a byte-match trap. One practical
consequence: sweeping this file for the `SLIDE4K` magic finds eighteen headers past
`0x7F2D8` that are residue, not a newly discovered compressed region.

`make audit-icons-blob` (`scripts/analysis/audit_icons_blob_coverage.py`) re-derives the
whole map from the tree and the factory dump on every run and fails if any of it drifts.
It checks four invariants: that the blob is still byte-identical to
`original_ROMs/kn5000_table_data.rom` over its extent; that the ASL mirror still
bincludes exactly `0, 0x7F2D8`; that no LLVM slice reaches past that extent; and that the
dead tail is still exactly the eighteen preset blocks plus `0xFF` fill. It is not part of
`make all`.

## What is still open

The ROM is byte-complete in source form, but understanding lags behind location in several
places:

* **Preset-bank semantics.** Sections 0-32 are located, sized and grid-analysed, but no
  code reads an individual directory entry, so which section backs which user memory is
  still unattributed.
* **Shade-ramp consumers.** The wallpaper trailer ramps have no traced reader; the RGB
  interpretation is inferred from their shape.
* **Panel Memory / Music Stylist parameter blocks.** The chunk and record framing is
  settled; most parameter payloads inside them are still undecoded MIDI-range values.
* **Tone-record fields.** The record framing is exact; several fixed-value fields have no
  established meaning yet (see the tone-database page).
* **Housekeeping — settled.** Both items previously listed here are closed. The seven
  orphaned `bootcode_*.bin` files were deleted along with 25 other unreferenced
  extraction artefacts (commit `7280bce`; six `bootcode_*` remain because the archived
  ASL mirror still bincludes them). The dead tail of `includes/icons_to_strings.bin` was
  measured, explained and left in place on purpose — see *The backing blob* above.

Work on the wider disassembly is also unfinished: the v7 firmware tree has not been
converted, and the Main-CPU inline `.byte` audit is still pending. Neither affects the
table-data ROM's own coverage.
